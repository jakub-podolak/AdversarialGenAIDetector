        "Original Question": "ELI5: Why are PS4 and PS5 unable to read PS1 or PS2 discs?",
        "Answer": "PS1 and some PS2 disks are based on the CD standard. The drive in a PS4 (and I assume PS5) doesn't read CDs. Among other things it's only equipped with lasers for DVD (650nm) and Blu-ray (450nm).",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "Why did the PS3 use a different laser for DVDs and Blu-ray discs? Was it a limitation of the Blu-ray technology or a design choice?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "[As far as I know, a lot of PS2 games were on DVD though. Based on this, I have a follow-up question ..?]A lot of PS2 games were on DVD though. Why can't the console read those?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: Why are PS4 and PS5 unable to read PS1 or PS2 discs?",
        "Answer": "The disc producers aren’t able to recreate the same data they used for those discs as they do with current models, the PS4 and PS5.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "Does that mean that future console generations will still not be able to read older discs, due to similar limitations?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "[You mention recreate the data but don't explain the mechansims. Based on this, I have a definition followup question: ]This may be a lot to ask but could you elaborate on the process of recreating data?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: Why aren’t there insects the size of man or larger?",
        "Answer": "They don’t breath the same way mammals do. They have tubes in various parts of their body that expose their circulatory system to air where it absorbs oxygen. Because they don’t inhale, they air limited in size by the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Which is why they used to be bigger in past eras when there was more oxygen in the atmosphere.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "Is it possible to imagine a scenario where insects could evolve to breathe like mammals, and if so, what kind of selective pressures or environmental factors would be needed to make such a evolution more likely?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "[One example of insect is roach, which is harmful for people. Based on this, I have a follow-up question on people deliminating roaches:]Is this why soap and water works in roach? It clogged up their breathing pores?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: What is it that you see when you press your finger between your eye socket and eyeball, on the eyelid?",
        "Answer": "The light sensing cells in your retina fire off not only from light but also from pressure.  When you press on your eyeball you increase the pressure inside of your eye which then causes cells in your retina to fire off.  Your brain then interprets this as light.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "What happens if you press on the retina itself, not just the eyelid?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "[] So the black spot and light circle around it, is a reaction of the pressure, on the opposite side of the eye?"

    {
        "Original Question": "ELI5: Why do words stop sounding like words when thought about too much?",
        "Answer": "When you say or think of a word (for example, “pink”), it creates a sensation in your brain. That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as “pink”. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as “reuptake.”  Thus, when you first think “pink,” all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, “tired out” in a way, and aren’t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don’t. They can’t half fire and create a weak image. Instead, the idea of pink gets less and less clear as less and less neurons are working to create the image until they all “pass out” and you’re left thinking “...what IS pink?”",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "How can I prevent or reduce this phenomenon when thinking about words and concepts?  How can I keep my neurons firing strongly and clearly?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "Side question: why would repeating the same phrase over and over lead to memorizing it if the neurons respond less and less to the stimulation?  I know it's better to memorize a little bit over a long period if you really want it memorized. But in short-term, like a week, it seems like just wearing your brain out on it is better?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: What are scripts in terms of code?",
        "Answer": "Typically a script refers to a small application written in a high level programming language that isn't compiled in to an executable file which typically automates a process rather than being an application that a user interacts with.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "Are scripts typically used in web development, and if so, what are some common examples of scripts used in web development?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "So like, say I coded a quick grade calculator in Python. That would be a script right? While an actual game in C++ that I could run would be a program?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: Air weighs 14 pounds per square inch, yet we don't feel it crushing us. The notion that internal pressure somehow acts as a counterbalance just seems to mean that we're being crushed in both directions. Shouldn't we feel this massive weight on us?",
        "Answer": "It's pressure, not weight. It's not a directed force, it's force on every surface. The air pushing in from above has the same force as the one pushing from below, same for left and right, etc.  And yes, we *are* being constantly squished together by air pressure. That pressure is even necessary for life. Water is only liquid at room temperature because the pressure squishes it together, preventing it from boiling.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "So, since we're being squished from all sides, does that mean that our bodies are actually at the same pressure as the air around us, and if so, how does this work?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "So water would boil in space?"

        "Answer": "Do not confuse weight and pressure. When you hold a piece of paper horizontally, it feels the same pressure on both sides, so it balances out and all that you feel is the weight of the paper itself.   Your body is mostly water, so it does not compress but when you free dive in water, as the pressure increases, the air pressure in your lungs does not increase so the water actually compresses your lungs. Then you will definitely feel the pressure.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "What's the difference between pressure and compression? Can you explain it in simple terms?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "Thank you. I was stuck at air weighing 14 lb. I'm like, almost three 5 lb bags of sugar in one square inch?"

        "Original Question": "ELI5: What difference does the vocal cords of a person who can sing have in comparison to someone who can't?",
        "Answer": "Absolutely nothing. The vocal chords are an instrument, the same as a trumpet or clarinet. Anyone is capable of singing well, the difference between someone who is good and who is bad is practice, technique, and for some, proper training. There have been studies proving that anyone can be taught to sing despite the fact that they have any practice in singing or not.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "What specific practices and techniques can be used to improve singing skills, regardless of prior experience?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "Is there any biological differences in someone’s singing ability when it comes to how well they can hear the true pitch that they are putting out? Not vocal chord related obviously, but the idea that anyone can kind of baffles me. I mean my friend. Asking for a friend."

        "Original Question": "ELI5: How do phones listen for the voice command ‘hey Siri/Google’ constantly and not run out of battery?",
        "Answer": "On an iPhone at least inside the A series CPUs is a coprocessor that is always running, ultra low power and basically runs a deep neural net looking for the \"Hey, Siri\" phrase along with a few other things (motion data is the other big one). This coprocessor is extremely specialized, extremely simple, and uses next to no power because of that. Once it thinks it has heard \"Hey, Siri\" it sends a message to fire up the main CPU and process the rest of the message.  There's [a really good paper](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri) that Apple wrote about how the deep neural net distinguishes the sounds if you want to go deeper.",
        "Machine-generated Follow-up Question": "How does the deep neural network that runs on the coprocessor distinguish the \"Hey, Siri\" phrase from other sounds, such as background noise or other voice commands?",
        "Human-generated Follow-up Question": "It just occurred to me that this is one of those cases where the neural network basically matches almost exactly how our unconscious picks out our name, even when we're half asleep. Is anyone able to confirm that's what happens with humans too?"
