1824,460.0,"Mr Bird, 78, from Barnsley, was regarded as one of the game's most popular and consistent umpires.
A guard of honour by the players and a standing ovation from the crowd marked his final Test, between England and India, at Lord's in 1996.
After retiring in 1998, he set up the Dickie Bird Foundation which gives grants to under-privileged children.
Speaking about the award, Mr Bird told the BBC: ""It came as quite a surprise... but I'm tremendously delighted and honoured to get this great honour, this OBE.
""It's a marvellous and wonderful honour and I never expected it, really.
""It came out of the blue, because I got the MBE in 1986 which is a long time ago, and so when this came along I was completely stunned, shocked.""
Talking about his foundation, Mr Bird said: ""It's for under-privileged kids, who the mothers and parents can't afford to buy them sports equipment... and if we think they are a worthy cause then we send them a grant.
""And my aim is to get them off street corners, away from television, doing exercises and giving them a start in life.""

"" Stopping them outside the store seals the deal . )",0,"I'm a police officer in Los Angeles. I've helped with a lot of arrests that regular people can make, but we don't call them citizen's arrests because you don't have to be a citizen to do it. I‚Äôll tell you how it works in California, but I don‚Äôt know about other places. 

There are two kinds of crimes: misdemeanors and felonies. Usually, we need a warrant to arrest someone, but there are some special times when we don‚Äôt. One time is if we think a felony happened. For example, if someone shoots another person and three people saw it, we can arrest that person right away without a warrant. 

Another time we can arrest someone without a warrant is if we see a misdemeanor crime happening. Like if we get a call about a rude customer at a restaurant, and when we get there, the customer is still being rude and won‚Äôt leave, we can arrest them for trespassing because we saw it happen. 

But if a misdemeanor crime happens and we didn‚Äôt see it, we can‚Äôt arrest anyone without a warrant. 

Now, about Private Person's Arrests: these are for misdemeanors that we didn‚Äôt see. A common example is shoplifting. Here‚Äôs how it goes: a loss prevention officer sees someone take something from a store without paying and leave. They stop the person outside and take them back to the store to wait for the police. When the police arrive, the loss prevention officer fills out a form saying they saw the person steal something and that they are making a Private Person's Arrest. Then the police take that person in for booking, but in the report, the loss prevention officer is called the Arresting Officer, and the police are the Transporting Officers. 

Loss prevention officers usually stop shoplifters outside the store because it‚Äôs easier to prove they did something wrong. If they stop them inside, the person could say they were going to pay, but if they stop them outside, it‚Äôs clear they were stealing.","I am a Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. Having engaged in numerous Private Person Arrests (we refrain from referring to them as citizen arrests, as one does not necessarily need to be a citizen of the United States to execute such an arrest), I will elucidate the process as it pertains to California. I am unable to comment on the laws of other states or countries, as I lack that knowledge. This explanation will be presented in a manner akin to an ELI15 format.

In California, there are two categories of crimes for which we may arrest individuals: Misdemeanors and Felonies. The law stipulates that police officers are generally prohibited from making arrests without a warrant, except under specific circumstances. The first circumstance occurs when there is probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed. For instance, if Suspect A shoots an individual and three witnesses assert, ""That individual committed the act,"" we are authorized to effectuate an arrest immediately without a warrant in this scenario.

Another exception arises when a misdemeanor is committed in our presence. For example, if we receive a call regarding a disruptive customer being asked to vacate a restaurant, and upon our arrival, the customer remains present, exhibiting unruly behavior and refusing to leave, we are empowered to make an arrest for misdemeanor trespassing, as the crime is occurring in our presence. There are additional exceptions that permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests, but they exceed the scope of this discussion. It is important to note that the law explicitly prohibits police officers from arresting individuals for misdemeanor offenses not committed in their presence; in such cases, a warrant must be obtained prior to arrest.

This leads us to the concept of Private Person's (or Citizen's) Arrest, which pertains to misdemeanor offenses not witnessed by a law enforcement officer. A prevalent example of this is shoplifting. In this scenario, a loss prevention officer observes a suspect selecting and concealing merchandise before exiting the store, bypassing open and staffed cash registers without making payment. The suspect is subsequently detained outside the store and escorted back to the loss prevention office to await the arrival of law enforcement.

Upon the police's arrival, the loss prevention officer completes a form that summarizes their observation of the suspect committing the misdemeanor offense of Petty Theft. They indicate that they, as a private individual, have placed the suspect under Private Person's Arrest and request that the police take the individual into custody for booking and processing. The arrest is then processed similarly to other arrests, with the distinction that the private individual is designated as the Arrest","üöìüëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hey everyone! As a Police Officer with the LAPD, I want to break down how Private Person Arrests work in California. Just a heads up, this info is specific to CA and I can't speak for other states or countries. 

In CA, we deal with two types of crimes: Misdemeanors and Felonies. Generally, we need a warrant to make an arrest, but there are exceptions! If we have probable cause that a felony has been committed (like if someone witnesses a shooting), we can arrest on the spot. For misdemeanors, we can act if the crime happens right in front of us‚Äîlike if we get called to a restaurant for a disruptive customer who refuses to leave.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about Private Person Arrests. These happen for misdemeanors that we don‚Äôt witness. A common example is shoplifting. If a loss prevention officer sees someone steal and leave the store, they can detain the suspect until police arrive. The officer then signs a form stating they observed the crime and request police to take the suspect into custody. 

The process is pretty standard from there, with the loss prevention officer listed as the Arresting Officer. This method helps solidify the case since stopping shoplifters outside the store makes it easier to prove intent. 

Hope this sheds some light on the process! Stay safe out there! ‚úåÔ∏è #LAPD #LawEnforcement #PrivatePersonArrest","Hey! So, I'm a cop with LAPD and I've dealt with a lot of Private Person Arrests (we don‚Äôt call them citizen arrests since u don‚Äôt have to be a US citizen to do it). Let me break it down for u how it works in California. I can‚Äôt really talk about other states or countries since I don‚Äôt know. 

So, there are 2 types of crimes we arrest for: Misdemeanors and Felonies. The law says we can‚Äôt arrest anyone without a warrant unless certain things happen. First, if we have probable cause that a felony happened. Like, if Suspect A shoots someone and 3 witnesses say, ‚ÄúHey, that guy did it,‚Äù we can arrest him right there without a warrant. 

Another case is if a misdemeanor happens in our presence. For example, if we get a call about a rude customer at a restaurant and we show up and the customer is still being a jerk and won‚Äôt leave, we can arrest him for trespassing since it‚Äôs happening right in front of us. There are other situations for warrantless misdemeanor arrests, but that‚Äôs a bit much for now. 

**Important note:** The law says we can‚Äôt arrest for a misdemeanor that didn‚Äôt happen in our presence; we‚Äôd need a warrant for that. 

Now, about Private Person‚Äôs (or Citizen‚Äôs) Arrests. These are for misdemeanors that didn‚Äôt happen in front of a cop. A common example is shoplifting. Here‚Äôs how it goes: a loss prevention officer sees someone take something and leave the store without paying. They stop the suspect outside and take them back to the loss prevention office to wait for the police. 

When the police arrive, the loss prevention officer fills out a form saying they saw the suspect commit the misdemeanor of Petty Theft and that they‚Äôre placing the person under Private Person‚Äôs Arrest, asking the police to take them in. After that, the arrest goes through like normal, but on the Arrest Report, the private person is listed as the Arresting Officer, and the cops are the ""Transporting Officers."" 

Oh, and just a side note: loss prevention officers usually stop shoplifters outside the store. It makes it easier to prove the crime. If they stop them inside, the suspect could just say, ‚ÄúI was gonna pay for it, you didn‚Äôt give me a chance.‚Äù Stopping them outside makes it clear.","I am a Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department. I have experience with numerous Private Person Arrests (referred to as such because one does not need to be a U.S. citizen to perform them). I will outline the process in California. I cannot provide information regarding other states or countries due to lack of knowledge. This explanation will be simplified for clarity. 

There are two categories of crimes for which arrests are made: Misdemeanors and Felonies. The law stipulates that police officers cannot arrest individuals without a warrant, except under specific conditions. The first condition is when there is probable cause to believe a felony has occurred. For instance, if Suspect A shoots someone and three witnesses confirm the act, an arrest can be made immediately without a warrant. 

Another condition is when a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence. For example, if we receive a call about a disruptive customer at a restaurant and upon arrival, the customer is still present, being unruly, and refusing to leave, we can arrest them for misdemeanor trespassing since the crime is occurring in our presence. There are additional exceptions for warrantless misdemeanor arrests, but those details are outside the scope of this explanation. 

The law clearly states that police officers cannot arrest for a misdemeanor not witnessed by them; a warrant must be obtained first. This leads us to Private Person's (or Citizen's) Arrests, which apply to misdemeanors not observed by law enforcement. A common example is shoplifting. 

In this scenario, a loss prevention officer sees a suspect select and conceal merchandise and exit the store without payment, bypassing open cash registers. The suspect is stopped outside the store and taken back to the loss prevention office to wait for police. When the police arrive, the loss prevention officer completes a form indicating they, as a private individual, witnessed the suspect commit the misdemeanor of Petty Theft and have placed the individual under Private Person's Arrest, requesting police custody for booking and processing. 

The arrest is then processed similarly to other arrests, with the distinction that the private individual is recorded as the Arresting Officer, while the police officers are designated as the ""Transporting Officers."" Additionally, loss prevention officers typically apprehend shoplifters outside the store to facilitate proof of the crime. If they were to stop individuals inside, it could be challenging to establish intent, as the suspect might claim they intended to pay. Stopping them outside solidifies the case.","I'm a police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department, and I've handled numerous Private Person Arrests. We don't refer to them as citizen's arrests because you don't have to be a U.S. citizen to make one. I'll break down how this works in California, but I can't speak for other states or countries since I'm not familiar with their laws. 

To keep it simple, there are two main categories of crimes we deal with: misdemeanors and felonies. Generally, police officers can't arrest someone without a warrant, except in specific situations. One of those situations is when we have probable cause to believe a felony has occurred. For instance, if Suspect A shoots someone and three witnesses confirm it, we can arrest that person immediately without a warrant. 

Another situation is when a misdemeanor is committed in our presence. For example, if we receive a call about a disruptive customer at a restaurant and we arrive to find that person still causing trouble and refusing to leave, we can arrest them for misdemeanor trespassing because the crime is happening right in front of us. There are additional circumstances that allow for warrantless misdemeanor arrests, but I won't get into those here. 

It's important to note that the law clearly states that we cannot arrest someone for a misdemeanor that wasn't witnessed by an officer; in those cases, a warrant is required first. 

Now, let's talk about Private Person Arrests. These are for misdemeanors that occur without a law enforcement officer present. A common example is shoplifting. Here's how it typically goes: a loss prevention officer sees someone take an item and hide it, then leave the store without paying, passing by open cash registers. The officer stops the suspect outside the store and brings them back to the loss prevention office to wait for the police. 

When the police arrive, the loss prevention officer fills out a form stating that they, as a private individual, witnessed the suspect commit the misdemeanor of petty theft and have placed them under Private Person's Arrest, requesting the police to take the suspect into custody for processing. The arrest is then handled like any other, except the private individual is listed as the Arresting Officer, while the police officers are noted as the ""Transporting Officers."" 

As a side note, loss prevention officers typically prefer to stop shoplifters outside the store. This approach makes it easier to prove the crime, as stopping someone inside could lead to claims of intent, with the suspect arguing they intended to pay.

3843,3011.0,"This paper presents a comparison of multifrequency positions of extragalactic sources obtained from the Global Geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Monitoring Program and the Gaia Early Data Release 3. The analysis is based on observations spanning from 2015 April to 2020 October, and includes a set of 496 sources that were observed with a total of 10,350 VLBI sessions and 33 Gaia EDR3 epochs. The VLBI data were processed using the DiFX software correlator and the ICRF3 catalog was used as the reference frame, while the Gaia EDR3 data were processed using the astrometric global iterative solution (AGIS) and the Gaia-CRF3 catalog was used as the reference frame. The aim of this study is to investigate the consistency and accuracy of the two different techniques in providing positions for extragalactic sources, and to identify potential systematic effects and sources of discrepancy.

The results of the comparison show a good agreement between the two methods, with a median difference in position of less than 30 microarcseconds for most sources.

One method is called VLBI, which stands for Very Long Baseline Interferometry, and the other is from a project called Gaia. The study looked at data from April 2015 to October 2020 and included 496 space objects that were checked during 10,350 VLBI sessions and 33 times with Gaia. They used special computer programs to analyze the data and made sure to use the right reference points for both methods.

The goal of this study was to see how well these two methods matched up and if there were any mistakes or differences in the positions they found. The results showed that most of the time, the two methods agreed really well, with only tiny differences in position. But for some objects, there were bigger differences, which could be caused by things like how the radio waves from the objects behave or errors in the data. The study also pointed out that using both methods together could help make the measurements even better in the future. Overall, this research helps scientists create a more accurate map of space and shows how important it is to use different ways to gather information.","This paper provides a comparative analysis of multifrequency positional data of extragalactic sources derived from the Global Geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Monitoring Program and the Gaia Early Data Release 3.

1619,45.0,"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.
I cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.
Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.
When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.
Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.
At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.
We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.
They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.
For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.
He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.
He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.
So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.
At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.
These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.
Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.
Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.
But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.
You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.
Villa's net spend over the summer was under ¬£10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.
They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.
I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.
You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.
I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.
Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.
The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.
Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.
In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.
But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.
Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.
Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.
Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.
Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.
However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.
When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.
You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.
That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.
After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.
A settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.
Chris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",0,"If he loses his job as the Premier League manager, it would be super unfair and totally silly. I used to clean Tim's boots when I was just starting out at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995. I‚Äôm not just cheering for him because we played together; I‚Äôve always thought he could be a great manager since I was young. I looked up to him because he was really good at handling things and was nice to everyone. Even though he was young too, all the other players thought he was great.

People talk a lot about character these days, but when I played, I looked for teammates who could handle pressure, and Tim was always one of those guys. Now that he‚Äôs 46, he‚Äôs still a young manager, but he was also a young captain at Blackburn when he was just 26 and we won. We had some big personalities on the team, like Alan Shearer and David Batty, but they all respected Tim for what he did as a player and a captain. For Tim to be captain over someone like Shearer shows how much the Blackburn boss, Kenny Dalglish, thought of him.

Tim has always had the qualities of a leader, and I think he knows a lot about football. He might seem a bit confident or even cocky, but in the locker room, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre shy or outgoing as long as what you say makes sense, and Tim always did. So, it‚Äôs not surprising that he has helped players who weren‚Äôt doing well, like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season, because he knows how to get people to play for him.

Sometimes he says things that players might not like because he tells the truth, and that can upset some people, but I think he should be praised for it. A lot of people in football say things that don‚Äôt mean much, but Tim always backs up what he says. He deserves a real chance to be the Villa boss because he did an amazing job keeping them up after he took over in February when they were in big trouble.

Villa has been trying to avoid getting kicked out of the league for a few years with different managers, so this season was going to be tough too. But just eight games in, it seems like Sherwood is already under a lot of pressure. You have to remember he lost his two best players over the summer, Bent","Should he become the next Premier League manager to be dismissed, it would not only be unjust but also utterly absurd. I had the opportunity to clean Tim's boots during my apprenticeship at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he served as the captain of Blackburn Rovers when we achieved Premier League victory together in 1995. My support for him at Aston Villa is not solely based on our past playing relationship; rather, it stems from my long-standing belief in his managerial potential since the early stages of my career.

As a teenager, I admired his approach to the game and his interactions with both myself and others. Despite being relatively young at that time, he garnered similar respect from his peers. The concept of character is often discussed in contemporary football, yet as a player, I sought teammates capable of managing pressure, and Tim consistently exemplified this quality.

At 46 years of age, he is considered a relatively young manager, particularly regarding experience; however, it is important to note that he was also a young captain at Blackburn, being just 26 when we became champions. Our dressing room included several prominent personalities, such as Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers, and Colin Hendry, all of whom were unafraid to express their opinions. Nevertheless, they would unanimously acknowledge Tim's contributions to the team, both as a player and as a captain, which is indicative of the esteem in which he was held by Blackburn's manager, Kenny Dalglish, who chose him as skipper over established players like Shearer.

Tim has always possessed the leadership qualities essential for a manager, and I have always regarded him as exceptionally knowledgeable about the game. While he may project confidence, or even arrogance, it is irrelevant in the dressing room whether one is an introvert or extrovert, provided that their contributions are coherent. Tim has consistently demonstrated this ability.

It is therefore unsurprising that he has successfully revitalized underperforming players, such as Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham Hotspur and Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Aston Villa last season, as he has always had the knack for motivating players to perform at their best. At times, he may express truths that players find uncomfortable, which can cause some discontent; however, I believe he should be commended for his honesty.

In today's football landscape, many individuals make statements devoid of substance, but Tim is not among them; he consistently substantiates his opinions. He has earned the opportunity to manage Aston Villa following the remarkable job he did to secure their Premier","If Tim ends up being the next Premier League manager to get the boot, it would be totally unfair and honestly ridiculous. I remember cleaning his boots back when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late '80s, and he was the captain at Blackburn when we won the Premier League in '95. My support for him at Villa isn't just because we played together; I've always seen him as a future manager since my early days. 

As a teenager, I admired how he handled pressure and dealt with everyone around him. At 46, he's still relatively young in management, but he was a young captain at 26 when we were champions. He had the respect of big personalities like Shearer and Batty, and they all recognized his leadership skills. 

Tim has a knack for getting the best out of players who may be underperforming, and while he might say things that ruffle feathers, he speaks the truth, which is refreshing in football. He deserves more time at Villa after the incredible job he did to keep them up last season, especially considering he lost key players like Benteke and Delph over the summer. 

Villa's net spend was under ¬£10m, focusing on young talent, which is a gamble. It's not fair to blame Tim for the squad's struggles if he wasn't solely responsible for the signings. The club's owner might be getting anxious, but giving Tim more time is the logical move. 

He's been experimenting with formations to find the right balance, especially with forwards like Gestede and Agbonlahor. Finding that balance is tough, especially with young talents like Grealish, who needs to improve defensively. 

With a settled system and continuity, I believe Tim can turn things around if given the chance. #SupportTim #Villa #PremierLeague","hey! so if he ends up being the next Prem manager to get sacked, it‚Äôd be super unfair and honestly kinda ridiculous. I used to clean Tim's boots back when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 80s, and he was the captain at Blackburn when we won the Prem in 1995. 

I‚Äôm not just backing him at Villa cuz we played together, I‚Äôve always thought he had what it takes to be a manager since I was a teen. I looked up to him for how he handled things and treated everyone. Even tho he was young too, all the other players felt the same way.

Tim has always possessed the leadership qualities essential for a manager, and I have always found him to be highly knowledgeable about the game.

Our approach builds on previous work in sketching algorithms by incorporating dynamism to the sketching process. 

We focus on cut-preserving sketching, which is an important problem in graph optimization that has applications in fields such as network traffic analysis, social network analysis, and image analysis. We show that our dynamic sketching method can accurately preserve the cuts in a graph while significantly reducing the size of the sketch.

This method helps us make smaller versions of big, complicated graphs so we can understand them better. We built on some earlier ideas about sketching but added a twist to make it more flexible.

We pay special attention to something called cut-preserving sketching. This is super important for solving problems with graphs, and it can help in things like figuring out how data moves in networks, studying social media, and looking at pictures. We found out that our dynamic sketching can keep the important parts of a graph while making the sketch much smaller.

3824,200.0,"During recent years, the renaissance of neural networks as the major machine learning paradigm and more specifically, the confirmation that deep learning techniques provide state-of-the-art results for most of computer vision tasks has been shaking up traditional research in image processing. The same can be said for research in communities working on applied harmonic analysis, information geometry, variational methods, etc. For many researchers, this is viewed as an existential threat. On the one hand, research funding agencies privilege mainstream approaches especially when these are unquestionably suitable for solving real problems and for making progress on artificial intelligence. On the other hand, successful publishing of research in our communities is becoming almost exclusively based on a quantitative improvement of the accuracy of any benchmark task. As most of my colleagues sharing this research field, I am confronted with the dilemma of continuing to invest my time and intellectual effort on mathematical morphology as my driving force for research, or simply focussing on how to use deep learning and contributing to it. The solution is not obvious to any of us since our research is not fundamental, it is just oriented to solve challenging problems, which can be more or less theoretical. Certainly, it would be foolish for anyone to claim that deep learning is insignificant or to think that one's favourite image processing domain is productive enough to ignore the state-of-the-art. I fully understand that the labs and leading people in image processing communities have been shifting their research to almost exclusively focus on deep learning techniques. My own position is different: I do think there is room for progress on mathematically grounded image processing branches, under the condition that these are rethought in a broader sense from the deep learning paradigm. Indeed, I firmly believe that the convergence between mathematical morphology and the computation methods which gravitate around deep learning (fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc.) is worthwhile. The goal of this talk is to discuss my personal vision regarding these potential interactions. Without any pretension of being exhaustive, I want to address it with a series of open questions, covering a wide range of specificities of morphological operators and representations, which could be tackled and revisited under the paradigm of deep learning. An expected benefit of such convergence between morphology and deep learning is a cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between both fields. In addition, I think the future answer to some of these questions can provide some insight on understanding, interpreting and simplifying deep learning networks.",0,"In the last few years, neural networks have become super popular for machine learning, especially deep learning, which is really good at computer vision tasks. This has made a big change in how people study image processing. Other areas like applied harmonic analysis and information geometry are also feeling this change. Some researchers are worried because funding for research is mostly going to these popular methods that solve real problems and help with artificial intelligence. Plus, getting research published is now mostly about showing better accuracy on tests. 

I‚Äôm in a tough spot because I love working on mathematical morphology, but I also see the need to focus on deep learning. It‚Äôs hard to decide what to do since my research is about solving tricky problems, not just basic stuff. It would be silly to say deep learning isn‚Äôt important or that my favorite area of image processing is good enough to ignore it. I know that many labs and experts in image processing are now mostly working on deep learning. 

But I believe there‚Äôs still a chance to make progress in mathematical image processing if we think about it in a new way that includes deep learning. I really think that combining mathematical morphology with deep learning methods, like different types of neural networks, could be very helpful. In my talk, I want to share my ideas about how these two areas can work together. I‚Äôll ask some questions about how we can look at morphological operators and representations in the light of deep learning. I hope that by mixing these two fields, we can share ideas and techniques. Also, I think that answering some of these questions could help us understand and simplify deep learning networks better.","In recent years, the resurgence of neural networks as the predominant paradigm in machine learning, particularly the affirmation that deep learning methodologies yield state-of-the-art outcomes for the majority of computer vision tasks, has significantly disrupted traditional research in image processing. This phenomenon is similarly observed within research communities engaged in applied harmonic analysis, information geometry, variational methods, and related fields. For numerous researchers, this development is perceived as an existential threat. On one hand, research funding agencies tend to favor mainstream methodologies, especially when these approaches are evidently effective in addressing real-world problems and advancing artificial intelligence. Conversely, the successful publication of research within our communities increasingly relies on quantitative enhancements in the accuracy of benchmark tasks. Like many of my colleagues in this research domain, I find myself grappling with the dilemma of whether to continue dedicating my time and intellectual resources to mathematical morphology, which has been my primary research focus, or to shift my attention towards the utilization of deep learning and contributing to that field. The resolution to this dilemma is not straightforward, as our research is not fundamentally theoretical; rather, it is aimed at addressing challenging problems that may possess varying degrees of theoretical underpinning. It would indeed be imprudent for anyone to assert that deep learning is inconsequential or to assume that their preferred area of image processing is sufficiently productive to disregard the advancements in state-of-the-art techniques. I fully recognize that laboratories and leading figures within the image processing community have increasingly redirected their research efforts to concentrate almost exclusively on deep learning methodologies. My perspective, however, diverges from this trend: I maintain that there exists potential for advancement in mathematically grounded branches of image processing, provided that these areas are reimagined within the broader context of the deep learning paradigm. I am convinced that the convergence of mathematical morphology with computational methods associated with deep learning‚Äîsuch as fully connected networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and recurrent neural networks‚Äîholds significant promise. The objective of this discourse is to articulate my personal vision regarding these prospective interactions. Without the intention of being exhaustive, I aim to explore this topic through a series of open questions that encompass a wide array of specificities related to morphological operators and representations, which could be revisited and addressed within the framework of deep learning. An anticipated advantage of such convergence between morphology and deep learning is the potential for cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques across both fields. Furthermore, I believe that future responses to some of these inquiries may yield valuable insights into the understanding, interpretation, and simplification of deep learning networks.","üöÄ Over the past few years, neural networks have taken the spotlight in machine learning, especially with deep learning leading the charge in computer vision tasks.

The same goes for areas like applied harmonic analysis and info geometry. A lot of researchers feel like this is a big threat to their work. 

On one hand, funding agencies are all about the mainstream methods, especially since they actually solve real problems and help with AI progress.

3350,738.0,"Oxygen is a much better evolutionary index than iron to describe the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB) since it is the main producer of these light elements at least in the early Galaxy. The O-Fe relation is crucial to the determination of the exact physical process responsible for the LiBeB production. At low metallicity, if [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] is flat, then the production mode is independent of the interstellar metallicity, BeB is proportional to oxygen, i.e. is of primary nature. If not, the production mode is function of the progressive enrichment in O of the interstellar medium, BeB varies rather as the square of O, i.e. is of secondary nature. In the first case, fast nuclei enriched into He, C and O injected by supernovae and accelerated in surrounding superbubbles would explain the primary trend.

In the second case, the main spallative agent would be the standard galactic cosmic rays. Calculated nucleosynthetic yields of massive stars, estimates of the energy cost of production of beryllium nuclei, and above all recent observations reported in this meeting seem to favor the primary mechanism, at least in the early Galaxy.",0,"Oxygen is a better way to understand how Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron (LiBeB) were made in space than iron because it makes these light elements, especially in the early days of the Galaxy. The relationship between oxygen and iron helps us figure out how LiBeB was created. If the amount of oxygen compared to iron stays the same when there‚Äôs less metal, it means that the way LiBeB is made doesn‚Äôt depend on how much metal is in space, and it‚Äôs mostly made from oxygen. But if it changes, then how LiBeB is made depends on how much oxygen is in space, and it‚Äôs made differently. In the first situation, supernova explosions send out fast particles that are rich in helium, carbon, and oxygen, which explains how it‚Äôs made. 

In the second situation, cosmic rays in the galaxy would be the main thing that breaks down other elements to make beryllium. Scientists have looked at how stars make these elements and how much energy it takes to create beryllium, and new observations from this meeting suggest that the first way of making LiBeB is more likely, especially in the early Galaxy.","Oxygen serves as a significantly more effective evolutionary index than iron for elucidating the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB), as it is the principal producer of these light elements, particularly in the early stages of the Galaxy. The relationship between oxygen and iron is essential for accurately identifying the specific physical processes responsible for the production of LiBeB. In scenarios of low metallicity, if the plot of [O/Fe] against [Fe/H] remains constant, it indicates that the production mode is independent of the interstellar metallicity, suggesting that BeB is directly proportional to oxygen, thereby indicating a primary nature. Conversely, if this relationship is not flat, the production mode becomes dependent on the progressive enrichment of oxygen in the interstellar medium, leading to BeB varying approximately as the square of oxygen, which indicates a secondary nature. In the former scenario, the primary trend could be explained by fast nuclei enriched in helium, carbon, and oxygen that are ejected by supernovae and subsequently accelerated within surrounding superbubbles.

In the latter scenario, the predominant spallative agent would be the standard galactic cosmic rays. The calculated nucleosynthetic yields from massive stars, assessments of the energy expenditure required for the production of beryllium nuclei, and, most importantly, recent observations presented at this meeting appear to support the primary mechanism, at least during the early phases of the Galaxy.","üåå Did you know? Oxygen is a way better indicator than iron when it comes to understanding the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB) in the early Galaxy! üåü The relationship between O and Fe is key to figuring out how these light elements were produced. If the [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] graph is flat at low metallicity, it means the production is independent of interstellar metallicity, making BeB directly proportional to oxygen (primary nature). If it‚Äôs not flat, then the production depends on the oxygen enrichment in the interstellar medium, with BeB varying as the square of O (secondary nature). 

In the primary scenario, supernovae inject fast nuclei enriched in He, C, and O, while in the secondary case, galactic cosmic rays play a major role. Recent observations and calculations suggest that the primary mechanism is favored, especially in the early Galaxy! üöÄ‚ú® #Astrophysics #GalaxyHistory #LiBeB","Hey! So, like, oxygen is way better than iron for tracking the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB), especially in the early Galaxy, since it‚Äôs the main source of those light elements. The O-Fe relationship is super important for figuring out how LiBeB is made. If we look at low metallicity and see that [O/Fe] vs [Fe/H] is flat, it means the production doesn‚Äôt depend on interstellar metallicity, and BeB is linked to oxygen, which means it‚Äôs primary. But if it‚Äôs not flat, then the production changes with the increase of O in the interstellar medium, and BeB would vary more like the square of O, meaning it‚Äôs secondary. 

In the first scenario, fast nuclei enriched in He, C, and O from supernovae and accelerated in superbubbles could explain the primary trend. In the second scenario, the main spallative agent would be the usual galactic cosmic rays. Recent observations and calculations of massive stars‚Äô nucleosynthetic yields seem to support the primary mechanism, at least for the early Galaxy.","Oxygen serves as a superior evolutionary index compared to iron for detailing the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB), as it is the primary source of these light elements, particularly in the early Galaxy. The relationship between oxygen and iron is essential for identifying the specific physical processes that lead to LiBeB production. At low metallicity, if the [O/Fe] ratio remains constant against [Fe/H], it indicates that the production mechanism is not influenced by interstellar metallicity, suggesting that BeB is directly proportional to oxygen, thus indicating a primary origin. Conversely, if this relationship is not flat, the production mechanism is dependent on the increasing oxygen content in the interstellar medium, leading to BeB varying as the square of oxygen, indicating a secondary origin. In the primary scenario, the trend can be explained by fast nuclei enriched in helium, carbon, and oxygen, which are released by supernovae and accelerated within surrounding superbubbles.

In the secondary scenario, the primary spallation agent would be standard galactic cosmic rays. Current calculations of nucleosynthetic yields from massive stars, assessments of the energy required for beryllium nucleus production, and recent observations presented at this meeting appear to support the primary production mechanism, particularly in the early Galaxy.","Oxygen serves as a more effective evolutionary marker than iron when it comes to understanding the history of Lithium-Beryllium-Boron (LiBeB), particularly because it was the primary source of these light elements in the early stages of the Galaxy. The relationship between oxygen and iron is essential for pinpointing the specific physical processes that lead to the production of LiBeB. When metallicity is low, if the [O/Fe] ratio remains constant against [Fe/H], it indicates that the production method is not influenced by the metallicity of the interstellar medium, meaning that BeB is directly proportional to oxygen and is considered primary in nature. Conversely, if this relationship is not flat, it suggests that the production method depends on the increasing oxygen levels in the interstellar medium, with BeB varying roughly as the square of oxygen, indicating a secondary nature. In the primary scenario, the trend could be explained by fast nuclei enriched in helium, carbon, and oxygen that are released by supernovae and then accelerated within surrounding superbubbles.

In the secondary scenario, the primary source of spallation would be the typical galactic cosmic rays. Current calculations of nucleosynthetic yields from massive stars, along with estimates of the energy required to produce beryllium nuclei, and particularly the recent observations shared at this meeting, seem to support the idea of a primary production mechanism, especially in the early Galaxy."

Australia would have won had replacement Kurtley Beale not failed with two late penalties.
""It was a remarkable win and a remarkable result,"" North said.
""It was an unbelievable feeling. We won and I got my first [Lions] Test try. It doesn't get much better than that.
""My heart was in my mouth at the end. I think everyone was feeling the same.
""It's always good to get a win, and while it was tough towards the end we are delighted to have got that first win in the series.
""We've spoken a lot about momentum these past few weeks, and that could be huge for us now heading into the second Test next week.""
The Wallabies were leading 7-3 through Israel Folau's converted before the Lions hit back with a fine individual try from North.
The 21-year-old, making his Lions Test debut, effortlessly beat three players during a 60-metre run before crossing for his third try of the tour.
""When the ball dropped out of the sky, my first thought was just to run,"" said North.
""Luckily, I saw a gap and I just went for it. It opened up for me, and I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line.""
North, who has joined Northampton Saints from Scarlets ahead of the 2013-14 season, thought he had struck again just five minutes later when he squeezed over in the corner.
But the television match official ruled a combination of opposite number Israel Folau getting a hand underneath the ball and the Lions wing's free arm hitting the touchline meant no try.
""I felt it was a try. At the end of the day, the TMO makes his call and you have to live with it. But I certainly felt that I had got there,"" North added.
""Perhaps one or two things didn't quite go for us in that regard today, so it makes the win even better.""
The Lions face Melbourne Rebels, led by former Wales number eight Gareth Delve, on Tuesday before next Saturday's second Test against the Wallabies in the same city.
Victory at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium would secure a first Lions Test series win since 1997 but North believes there is room for improvement.
""I definitely think we can play a lot better than we did,"" North added.
""We need to be more clinical, and we need to get a bit more accuracy in our game.
""It's a funny one, really. We know we can play better than that, but we are obviously still delighted to get the win.
""That wasn't our best performance, and we need to keep pushing for next week.""
North's Wales team-mate Cuthbert, who scored the Lions' second try, expects an Australian backlash in the second Test.
""Australia are not going to lie down and let us win this,"" Cuthbert said.

We‚Äôve talked a lot about keeping the momentum going, and this win could really help us for the next game next week.""

The Wallabies were ahead 7-3 thanks to a try by Israel Folau, but then North scored a fantastic try all by himself. He ran 60 meters and dodged three players to score his third try of the tour. North said, ""When the ball came down, I just wanted to run. Luckily, I saw a space and went for it. It felt amazing when I crossed the line."" North, who is now playing for Northampton Saints, thought he scored again just five minutes later, but the referee said it wasn‚Äôt a try because Folau touched the ball and North's arm went out of bounds.

He added, ""Maybe a few things didn‚Äôt go our way today, so winning makes it even better.""

Next, the Lions will play against the Melbourne Rebels, who are led by Gareth Delve, a former Wales player, on Tuesday before their second Test against the Wallabies next Saturday.

Qantas and Virgin Australia have also told customers not to charge or use the phone during flights.
Samsung said it would speed up shipments of replacement Galaxy Note 7 phones to ease safety concerns.
Earlier this week, US TV channel Fox 10 reported claims that a faulty Galaxy Note 7 had set fire to a family's Jeep.
Samsung has said that battery problems were behind the phones catching fire, but that it was difficult to work out which phones were affected among those sold.
""In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage,"" the FAA said.
Following Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7, Qantas said on Thursday it was ""requesting that passengers who own [the devices] do not switch on or charge them in-flight.""
The phone was launched last month and has been otherwise generally well-received by consumers and critics.
Some 2.5 million Note 7s have been shipped globally.
Samsung has said customers who have already bought the phone will be able to swap it for a new one and that it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices.

This is precautionary advice and not understood to be in reaction to any incident on a plane.
But it does continue the headache for Samsung - even once the company goes through the motions of getting the device recalled, the Note 7 will forever be the exploding smartphone.
This is not the first time the FAA has warned about the dangers of lithium batteries on flights. Earlier this year, it urged airlines to assess the risk of transporting lithium batteries as cargo.
And the administration also insists that any spare lithium battery be kept with the passenger rather than kept with luggage in the hold - though as a person who regularly travels with big lithium batteries for camera equipment, I can tell you this is inconsistently enforced.
What makes lithium batteries catch fire?
The US trade group Airlines for America said it was ""closely monitoring"" the Note 7 issue and that carriers in the US would make their own ruling over the use of the phone on board.
""Each individual carrier makes determinations, in compliance with FAA safety rules and regulations, as to what is permitted to be carried on board and in the cargo hold,"" an Airlines for America spokesperson said in a statement.

Samsung has attributed the incidents of combustion to battery issues, although it has indicated that identifying the specific affected units among those sold has proven challenging.

""In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung regarding its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to activate or charge these devices aboard aircraft and to avoid stowing them in checked baggage,"" stated the FAA. Following Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7, Qantas announced on Thursday that it is ""requesting that passengers who possess [the devices] refrain from switching them on or charging them during flights."" The phone, which was launched last month, has generally received positive feedback from both consumers and critics, with approximately 2.5 million units shipped worldwide. Samsung has assured customers who have already purchased the device that they will be able to exchange it for a new one, with an estimated two-week timeframe for preparing replacement units.

Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, indicates that this advisory is precautionary and is not perceived as a response to any specific incident occurring on an aircraft. However, it continues to pose challenges for Samsung; even after the recall process is completed, the Note 7 will be permanently associated with incidents of combustion. This is not the first instance in which the FAA has cautioned about the hazards of lithium batteries on flights. Earlier this year, the agency urged airlines to evaluate the risks associated with transporting lithium batteries as cargo. Furthermore, the FAA mandates that any spare lithium batteries be kept with the passenger rather than in checked luggage; however, as someone who frequently travels with large lithium batteries for camera equipment, I can attest that this regulation is not consistently enforced.

What causes lithium batteries to ignite?

So, the FAA is saying not to pack those phones in checked luggage. Last week, Samsung recalled the Note 7 after reports of it exploding while charging. Qantas and Virgin Australia also told peeps not to charge or use the phone on flights. Samsung's trying to speed up sending out replacement Note 7s to calm safety worries. 

Oh, and Fox 10 reported that a faulty Note 7 set a family's Jeep on fire. Samsung said the fires were due to battery issues, but it's tough to figure out which phones are affected. The FAA said, ""Due to recent incidents and Samsung's concerns, we strongly advise passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on planes and not to put them in checked bags."" 

After the recall, Qantas asked passengers not to use or charge the phones in-flight. The Note 7 launched last month and was generally liked by users and critics, with about 2.5 million shipped worldwide. Samsung said customers can swap their phones for new ones, and it‚Äôll take about two weeks to get those ready.

So, this is just precautionary and not because of any specific incident on a plane. But it‚Äôs still a headache for Samsung since the Note 7 will always be known as the exploding phone. The FAA has warned about lithium batteries before, urging airlines to check the risks of transporting them. They also say spare lithium batteries should stay with passengers, not in checked luggage, but I can tell you that‚Äôs not always enforced.

As for why lithium batteries catch fire, the US trade group Airlines for America is keeping an eye on the Note 7 situation, and US carriers will decide what to do about it. Each airline makes its own rules based on FAA safety guidelines.

968,160.0,"The Conservative leader said a future government led by him would build 100,000 new homes for such people.
They would be built on brownfield land already identified for development and exempt from some taxes, he said.
He was speaking as the party prepares for its annual conference this weekend.
Conservative politicians and activists will gather in Birmingham from Sunday for what is the final conference before next May's general election.
Unveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own home.
""I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value.
""They can't be bought by foreigners, they can't be bought by buy-to-let landlords, they can't be flipped round in a quick sale. They can only be bought by hard working people under the age of 40.""
The starter homes plan would apply only to England, whereas Help to Buy is UK-wide.
That scheme entails the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build properties.
Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said Mr Cameron had presided over the lowest level of house building in peacetime since the 1920s.
""After four and a half years he now tells us that he is going to deliver for first-time buyers but under his government a record one in four young people are living at home with their parents and young people across the country are priced out of home ownership.
""Labour will make the fundamental changes to the market which are urgently needed and will double the number of first-time buyers in the next 10 years.""
Campbell Robb, of homelessness charity Shelter, welcomed the pledge but said it was ""absolutely vital"" that the homes built were ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes"".
""There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own,"" he said.
Grainia Long, of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said she welcomed ""the focus on supply and affordability"" but still had ""some serious concerns"".
She said: ""This smacks of building for one group of people at the expense of another.
""Social housing is critical if we are going to solve the housing crisis - there are always going to be people who can't afford to buy and we must provide decent, affordable homes for them too.
""Equally, we'd like to see more investment in shared ownership to help people on lower incomes. If all the focus is on home ownership, we are never going to build mixed communities.""
Under the new proposals, the homes would be built on brownfield land which was no longer needed for industrial or commercial use.
Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said.
Public sector land would also be used to deliver the pledge.
The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.
Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.
The zero carbon homes standard, which applies from 2016, aims to improve energy efficiency.
It requires house builders to decrease all carbon emissions from energy arising from fixed heating and lighting, hot water and other fixed building services - such as ventilation - in new homes.",0,"The leader of the Conservative party said that if he becomes the boss of the government, he will make 100,000 new homes for people who need them. These homes will be built on land that is already ready for building and won't have to pay some taxes. He was talking about this as his party gets ready for their big meeting this weekend in Birmingham, which is the last one before the election next May.

He shared this plan, which is like a new version of the Help to Buy program, because he wants more young people to be able to own their own homes. He said, ""I want young people who work hard to be able to buy a home. So these starter homes will cost 20% less than what they usually cost."" 

Only people under 40 who work hard can buy these homes, and they can't be bought by foreigners or landlords who want to rent them out. This plan is just for England, while Help to Buy is for the whole UK. Help to Buy helps people by giving them a loan for 20% of the cost of new homes.

A person from the Labour party, Emma Reynolds, said that under Mr. Cameron, not many houses have been built since the 1920s. She pointed out that many young people are still living with their parents because they can't afford their own homes. She said Labour will make important changes to help more first-time buyers in the next 10 years.

Campbell Robb, who works for a charity that helps homeless people, liked the idea but said it‚Äôs really important that the homes are affordable for young families. He worried that if builders don‚Äôt have to make affordable homes, this plan might not help the people who need it the most.

Grainia Long, from a housing group, also liked that they are focusing on making more homes but had some worries. She said it seems like they are only helping one group of people and not others. She believes we need social housing for people who can‚Äôt buy homes and that we should also help people with lower incomes. If they only focus on home ownership, we won‚Äôt have mixed communities.

The new homes will be built on land that isn‚Äôt used for factories or businesses anymore. The money saved from using this land will help lower the prices for buyers. They will also use public land to build these homes. Mr. Cameron said these homes won‚Äôt have to pay a lot of taxes and won‚Äôt need to include social housing in their plans. Some building rules, like the one for zero carbon homes","The leader of the Conservative Party has asserted that a future administration under his leadership would construct 100,000 new residences for individuals in need. These homes would be situated on brownfield sites that have already been designated for development and would be exempt from certain taxes, as he indicated. His remarks were made in anticipation of the party's annual conference scheduled for this weekend. Conservative politicians and activists are set to convene in Birmingham starting Sunday for what will be the final conference prior to the general election in May.

In presenting this commitment‚Äîan extension of the Help to Buy mortgage initiative‚ÄîMr. Cameron expressed the Conservatives' desire for a greater number of young individuals to ""realize the dream"" of homeownership. ""I want young people who are diligent and responsible to have the opportunity to purchase their own homes. Therefore, these starter homes will be offered at a price 20% below the market value. They will not be available for purchase by foreign investors, buy-to-let landlords, or for quick resale. They will solely be accessible to hardworking individuals under the age of 40.""

The starter homes initiative will be applicable exclusively in England, in contrast to the UK-wide Help to Buy scheme, which provides a 20% equity loan to purchasers of newly constructed properties. Shadow Housing Minister Emma Reynolds criticized Mr. Cameron, stating that he has overseen the lowest rate of housing construction in peacetime since the 1920s. ""After four and a half years, he now claims he will deliver for first-time buyers, yet under his administration, a record one in four young people are residing with their parents, and young individuals nationwide are being priced out of homeownership. Labour will implement the essential reforms to the market that are urgently required and will double the number of first-time buyers over the next decade.""

Campbell Robb, representing the homelessness charity Shelter, expressed support for the pledge but emphasized the necessity for the homes constructed to be ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families with average incomes."" He voiced concerns that the removal of the obligation for developers to include affordable housing could undermine the policy's effectiveness for those facing significant challenges in securing their own homes. Grainia Long from the Chartered Institute of Housing welcomed the emphasis on supply and affordability but raised ""serious concerns."" She remarked, ""This appears to prioritize one demographic at the expense of another. Social housing is essential for addressing the housing crisis‚Äîthere will always be individuals who cannot afford to buy, and we must ensure the availability of decent, affordable homes for them as well. Additionally","üö® Big news from the Conservative leader!

As the party gears up for its annual conference in Birmingham this weekend, Mr. Cameron emphasized the goal of helping more young people achieve the dream of homeownership. However, critics like Shadow Housing Minister Emma Reynolds point out that under his leadership, house building has hit a record low, leaving many young people living at home with their parents. 

Homelessness charity Shelter and the Chartered Institute of Housing have welcomed the pledge but raised concerns about affordability and the need for social housing. They stress that we can't forget those who can't afford to buy and need decent, affordable homes too. 

The new homes will be built on previously used land, with savings passed on to buyers, and will be exempt from various taxes and some building regulations. Let's see how this unfolds! üèòÔ∏èüí¨ #HousingCrisis #HomeOwnership #ConservativePlans","So, the Conservative leader just said that if he gets to lead a future government, he plans to build 100,000 new homes for people in need. These homes will be on brownfield land that's already been picked for development and will be exempt from some taxes, he mentioned. 

He's talking about this right before their annual conference this weekend in Birmingham, where all the Conservative peeps will gather for the last conference before the general election next May. 

He revealed this new plan, which is kinda like an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme, and he wants more young folks to ""achieve the dream"" of owning their own place. He said, ""I want young people who work hard, who do the right thing, to be able to buy a home of their own. So these starter homes will be sold at 20% less than the market value."" 

But there are some rules: they can't be bought by foreigners or buy-to-let landlords, and they can't be flipped for a quick sale. Only hard-working people under 40 can buy them. 

This starter homes plan is just for England, while Help to Buy is for the whole UK. That scheme gives a 20% equity loan to buyers of new-build homes. 

Then, Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds jumped in, saying that under Mr. Cameron, house building has hit the lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s. She pointed out that after 4.5 years, he‚Äôs now saying he‚Äôll help first-time buyers, but a record one in four young people are still living with their parents, and many can‚Äôt afford to buy. She said Labour will make the changes needed to double the number of first-time buyers in the next decade. 

Campbell Robb from Shelter, a homelessness charity, liked the pledge but stressed it‚Äôs super important that the homes are ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families on ordinary incomes."" He‚Äôs worried that if developers don‚Äôt have to build affordable housing, this plan might not help those who really need it. 

Grainia Long from the Chartered Institute of Housing also welcomed the focus on supply and affordability but had some serious concerns.

These homes would be situated on previously developed land designated for construction and would be exempt from certain taxes. This statement was made in preparation for the party's upcoming annual conference this weekend. Conservative members and supporters will convene in Birmingham starting Sunday for the last conference before the general election scheduled for next May.

In presenting this commitment, which expands upon the Help to Buy mortgage initiative, Mr. Cameron expressed the Conservatives' desire for more young individuals to realize the aspiration of homeownership. He stated, ""I want young people who work hard and do the right thing to have the opportunity to purchase their own home. Therefore, these starter homes will be offered at 20% below market value."" He specified that these homes would not be available to foreign buyers, buy-to-let landlords, or for quick resale, and would only be accessible to hardworking individuals under the age of 40.

The starter homes initiative would be limited to England, in contrast to the UK-wide Help to Buy program, which provides a 20% equity loan to purchasers of new properties. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds criticized Mr. Cameron, asserting that he has overseen the lowest housing construction levels in peacetime since the 1920s. She remarked, ""After four and a half years, he now claims he will deliver for first-time buyers, yet under his administration, a record one in four young people live with their parents, and many are priced out of homeownership. Labour will implement essential market changes and double the number of first-time buyers within the next decade.""

Campbell Robb from the homelessness charity Shelter acknowledged the pledge but emphasized the necessity for the homes to be ""genuinely affordable for young couples and families with average incomes."" He expressed concern that eliminating the obligation for developers to include affordable housing might hinder assistance for those facing significant challenges in securing their own homes. Grainia Long from the Chartered Institute of Housing welcomed the emphasis on supply and affordability but raised ""serious concerns,"" stating, ""This appears to prioritize one demographic at the expense of another. Social housing is essential to address the housing crisis, as there will always be individuals unable to afford to buy, and we must provide suitable, affordable housing for them as well.""

Campbell Robb from the homelessness charity Shelter welcomed the announcement but stressed the importance of ensuring that the homes built are truly affordable for young couples and families with average incomes.

Grainia Long from the Chartered Institute of Housing also appreciated the emphasis on supply and affordability but raised significant concerns. She remarked that the plan seems to prioritize one demographic at the expense of others. She highlighted the necessity of social housing to address the housing crisis, noting that there will always be individuals who cannot afford to buy, and it is essential to provide them with decent, affordable housing. She also called for increased investment in shared ownership options to assist those on lower incomes, warning that focusing solely on homeownership could hinder the development of mixed communities.

It was part of a much wider system, he said, where pupils are rewarded with points which they can use to buy items.
But some parents accused the school of humiliating or bullying pupils.
Mr Tutt, who took over the secondary modern four years ago, said his students were rewarded far more than they were punished.
""This needs to be taken in a far wider context. We have a very well established behaviour sanction and reward system,"" he said, adding that behaviour was impeccable at the academy.
This included an online reward system, where students received points for good behaviour, which could be used to buy things like nail manicures or footballs.
Pupils at the school, 40% of whom are classed as disadvantaged, are also rewarded with free coffees or by being allowed to go to the front of the lunch queue, Mr Tutt said, as well as usual status positions, such as being made prefects.
One Facebook post, from Jodi Taylor, said: ""My god-daughter goes to this school and this is just a few of the things they threaten.
""She is frightened to go to school and she is a good girl. It is nothing short of bullying, the good kids are being treated as bad and been threatened on a daily basis.
""School is meant to be a fun part of growing up?""
A parent, also writing on Facebook, said that the idea was an ""absolute disgrace"", adding: ""My boys go to this school. If they try that with my boys I will seek legal action.""
Mr Tutt said the assembly apology sanction was reserved for extreme cases and had not yet been used.
""It is to deal with repeat offenders who have received fixed term exclusions. The type of behaviour being punished might include being in complete defiance of a teacher or physical violence.
""And bear in mind we are a school in a challenging environment and we want them to learn.""
He said there had been a very small minority of parents who did not sign up to the idea.
A letter to parents said: ""Any student whose behaviour disrupts the learning of others will be expected to stand up at the front in their faculty assembly, face their peers, and apologise to the whole faculty for letting them down.
It also says: ""As from now, if any student receives a repeat fixed term external exclusion then, as part of our reintegration process, their parent(s)/carer(s) will be expected to sit next to them in lessons and to supervise them at break and lunchtime, for the day following the exclusion.
""This will help students, whose poor behaviour has caused them to be excluded, settle back into lessons and academy life.""
Mr Tutt said students at risk of being excluded were offered a range of support and given pastoral care, because the school did everything it could to avoid permanent exclusions.
The school was in the top 7% of for academic progress across eight GCSEs in England during the 2015/16 academic year.

He explained that this is part of a bigger system where kids can earn points for good behavior and use those points to buy fun stuff. 

But some parents said the school was making kids feel bad or bullying them. Mr. Tutt, who has been running the school for four years, said that students get rewarded way more than they get in trouble. He mentioned that they have a good system for rewards and punishments, and that the kids behave really well at the academy.

The school has an online reward system where students can earn points for being good, and they can use those points to get things like nail manicures or footballs. Also, kids who might need extra help can get free coffees or skip to the front of the lunch line. Mr. Tutt said that 40% of the students come from families that need more support, and they can also get special roles like being prefects.

One parent, Jodi Taylor, wrote on Facebook that her god-daughter is scared to go to school because of the threats, even though she is a good student. She thinks it feels like bullying because good kids are being treated badly. Another parent said the idea was terrible and that if they tried it with her boys, she would take legal action.

Mr. Tutt explained that the assembly apology is only for really serious cases and hasn‚Äôt been used yet. It‚Äôs meant for kids who keep getting in trouble, like not listening to teachers or being violent. He said they want to help kids learn, especially since the school is in a tough area.

He mentioned that only a few parents didn‚Äôt agree with this idea. A letter to parents said that if a student disrupts others, they will have to stand in front of their classmates and apologize. It also said that if a student gets kicked out for a while, their parents will need to sit with them in class and watch them during breaks the next day to help them get back into school life.

Mr. Tutt, who has been at the helm of the secondary modern school for four years, asserted that students receive rewards far more frequently than they face punishment. ""This must be understood within a much broader context. We have a well-established system of behavioral sanctions and rewards,"" he stated, further noting that the behavior of students at the academy is exemplary.

This system includes an online rewards platform, where students earn points for positive behavior, which can be exchanged for items such as nail manicures or footballs. Additionally, students, 40% of whom are classified as disadvantaged, are rewarded with complimentary coffees or the privilege of advancing to the front of the lunch queue, as well as traditional status roles, such as being appointed prefects.

A Facebook post from Jodi Taylor expressed concern, stating: ""My god-daughter attends this school, and these are just a few of the threats they face. She is apprehensive about attending school despite being a well-behaved student. This is tantamount to bullying; the well-behaved students are being treated as if they are misbehaving and are subjected to threats daily. Shouldn't school be an enjoyable aspect of growing up?""

The midfielder revealed he had spoken first to the Celtic striker before signing his four-year contract.
""Moussa told me the club was good, it was fun here,"" said his fellow 21-year-old, who spent the last two seasons on loan with Genoa in Serie A.
""I'm very happy to be here and it's a new challenge for me.""
Ntcham never made the breakthrough into the senior side at the Etihad but did make 41 appearances during his two-year spell in Italy, 22 of them starts.
Genoa finished 11th in his first campaign in Serie A, but the Frenchman made only 10 starts as the Red and Blues ended last season in 16th place, two spots above the relegation zone.
He now hopes to mirror the success of compatriot Dembele, whose stunning debut season in Scottish football following his transfer from Fulham has led to him being linked with a move to some of European football's biggest clubs.
The France Under-21 striker was a team-mate of Ntcham's earlier in their international age-grade careers, recalling: ""I was maybe 14 when we played together.""
And the new arrival hopes Dembele sticks around to help him adapt to life in Scotland.
""He knows not all clubs are in the Champions League, so if you play in the Champions League, it's always good to stay,"" said Ntcham.
""That's why I chose to come here.""
Ntcham revealed he held talks with Celtic back in January and says a desire to play regular first-team football was a key factor in his decision to leave England's top flight and join Brendan Rodgers' squad.
""I spoke with Brendan before,"" he said. ""In January, Celtic was already there for me when I was in Italy, so that's why I came here.
""He said to me: 'You have to play because, if you don't play, you don't improve. You have to play because in Italy you don't play a lot'.
""It wasn't a tough decision for me. It was a normal decision because at Manchester City I play three years there and sometimes it is better to leave. Football is like this sometimes.""
Ntcham moved to City's youth ranks in 2012 from the Le Havre academy in his homeland and has represented France at every youth level from under-16s upwards.
Asked what kind of player Celtic fans can expect, he said: ""I am a powerful player and technical as well I think.""

Robredo, who struggled with a leg injury in the closing stages, fought back superbly from 5-3 down in the fourth set to claim victory.
Evans, ranked 179th, earned ¬£60,000 in prize money for his efforts and enough points to get close to the world's top 150, but missed out on a possible dream fourth-round match against Roger Federer.
""It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points,"" Evans told BBC Radio 5 live.
""I felt in pretty much total control of the match. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth.
""I just played two really loose points - that's all it was. They came at the wrong time. I just have to learn on that for next time.""
It was the British number three's sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows after coming through three rounds of qualifying, then beating 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic.
He had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament before New York, and playing under lights on the Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a sparse crowd, was a far cry from the Challenger events he is more used to.
Evans impressed in the opening set but 31-year-old Robredo's experience told as he edged it in the tie-break, then raced through the second in just 28 minutes.
Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace.
""I was sure the match was heading to a fifth set but Dan Evans just tightened up. After missing those set points in the fourth, he started rushing a bit, showed his inexperience and made a couple of bad shot choices.
""It is such a shame for him, but once he gets over the disappointment there is no doubt that there are so many positives. It looks like his career is going to go to another level after this tournament.""
Things seemed to be turning Evans's way when Robredo spent the next two changeovers having his left thigh massaged, but the Spaniard fought magnificently in the fourth set.
Evans was bristling with positive intent, moving forward at every opportunity, and twice broke to go ahead, but, serving at 5-3, 40-15, the nerves appeared to bite and he gave the set points up with a double fault and an error.
Robredo sensed his chance and pounded away from the baseline, drawing two more errors to recover the game and, after a solid hold, the pressure was quickly back on Evans.
From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point.
He closed in on the net to chase down another drop shot and leapt upon the Briton's response to angle away the volley and bring Evans's amazing US Open campaign to a sudden end.
""It's been a great experience, a great learning curve,"" added Evans, who heads to Croatia next for Great Britain's Davis Cup tie on 13-15 September.

Evans, who is ranked 179th, got ¬£60,000 for playing and got closer to being in the top 150 players in the world, but he missed the chance to play against Roger Federer in the next round. Evans told BBC Radio 5 live that it was hard to lose, especially since he had two chances to win the fourth set. He felt like he was in control of the match but couldn't get that last point to go to a fifth set. He said he just made a couple of mistakes at the wrong time and needs to learn from it.

This was Evans's sixth match in 10 days at the US Open after winning three qualifying rounds and beating two other good players. He had never won a match in a big tournament before this one, and playing in front of a crowd at the Louis Armstrong Stadium was very different from the smaller events he usually plays in.

Evans played really well at first, but Robredo, who is 31, used his experience to win the first set in a tie-break and then won the second set super fast in just 28 minutes. Evans almost lost in the third set but managed to win it with a great shot. 

After missing his chances in the fourth set, Evans got a bit nervous and made some mistakes. It was sad for him, but people think he has a lot of potential and can do even better in the future. 

Things looked good for Evans when Robredo was getting his leg treated, but Robredo played really well in the fourth set. Evans was trying hard and broke Robredo's serve twice to lead, but when he was serving at 5-3, he got nervous and made mistakes, which let Robredo come back. 

Suddenly, Evans was serving to stay in the match, and after a couple of mistakes, Robredo got to match point. He ran to hit a shot and won the match, ending Evans's great run at the US Open. 

Evans said it was a great experience and he learned a lot. He feels he can play with the best and is","The British player, aged 23, had two set points while serving, which could have led to a decisive fifth set; however, he was unable to capitalize on this opportunity. Consequently, Robredo triumphed in the third-round match with a score of 7-6 (8-6), 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, after three hours and 13 minutes of play. Despite grappling with a leg injury towards the end of the match, Robredo made a remarkable comeback from a 5-3 deficit in the fourth set to secure his victory.

Evans, currently ranked 179th, earned ¬£60,000 in prize money for his performance and accumulated sufficient points to approach the top 150 in the world rankings, although he missed the chance to face Roger Federer in a potential fourth-round match. ""It was a challenging match, particularly to lose in the fourth set after having served for it and holding two set points,"" Evans remarked during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I felt I was largely in control of the match. The final point is invariably the most difficult, and I was unable to secure that last point to extend the match to a fifth set. I simply played two rather careless points‚Äînothing more than that. They occurred at an inopportune moment, and I must learn from this experience for the future.""

This match marked the British number three's sixth encounter in a span of ten days at Flushing Meadows, following his success in three rounds of qualifying, as well as victories over the 11th seed Kei Nishikori and world number 52 Bernard Tomic. Prior to this tournament, he had never won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam event, and competing under the lights at Louis Armstrong Stadium, albeit in front of a limited audience, was a significant departure from the Challenger events to which he is accustomed.

Evans demonstrated commendable performance in the opening set; however, the 31-year-old Robredo's experience proved advantageous as he narrowly secured the set in a tie-break before swiftly claiming the second set in a mere 28 minutes. At 4-4 in the third set, defeat loomed for Evans, yet he managed to achieve a crucial break with a precise backhand volley, celebrating with a fist pump as he returned to his chair, ultimately serving out the set to love with an ace.

Despite battling a leg injury, Robredo made a stunning comeback from 5-3 down in the fourth set to clinch the win. 

Evans, ranked 179th, earned ¬£60,000 and valuable points, inching closer to the top 150, but missed out on a potential dream match against Roger Federer. ""I felt in pretty much total control of the match,"" he shared with BBC Radio 5 live. ""I just played two really loose points at the wrong time."" 

This was Evans' sixth match in 10 days at Flushing Meadows, and he showed impressive skills after coming through qualifying and defeating higher-ranked players. Although he had never won a Grand Slam match before, he proved he can compete at this level.

I want to explain this well, but I think it might just make people ask a ton of questions! So, photons and gluons are tiny particles that don‚Äôt have rest mass, but when they move super fast, like the speed of light, they have energy. The cool thing is that light always goes at the same speed, no matter who is watching, so you can never catch a photon just sitting still. It always has 'mass' when you think about energy and momentum. That‚Äôs about as much as I know from my science class. Some people wonder why things without mass can still be affected by gravity. The answer is that gravity bends space and time, which is like the path light takes. So, light is still going straight, but because space is bent, it looks like it‚Äôs curving. It‚Äôs not because gravity is pulling it, even though they are kind of related.","""Fields"" exist and possess no mass, including magnetic fields such as gravity. I am seeking an effective method to elucidate this concept; however, I am concerned that it may lead to a multitude of inquiries. Photons and gluons are devoid of rest mass, yet their motion at the speed of light enables them to possess equivalent energy. It is crucial to understand that light consistently travels at the speed of light (c), irrespective of the observer, which means that one will never observe a photon at rest; thus, it will always exhibit ""mass"" in terms of energy and momentum. This explanation aligns with my understanding at the A-level physics level. Furthermore, some individuals question how entities without mass can have their trajectories influenced by gravity. The response to this inquiry is that gravity distorts spacetime, the medium through which light propagates, allowing it to travel in a straight line within this warped space. Consequently, photons appear to follow curved paths in three-dimensional space, not due to gravitational attraction, although both phenomena share a common origin.","üåå Did you know that fields exist without mass?

3300,18911.0,"This paper focuses on the study of Pythagorean powers of hypercubes, which involves analyzing the relationship between the Pythagorean theorem and the geometry of hypercubes. We investigate the properties of these unique mathematical objects, including their dimensions, volumes, and coordinates, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their behavior and applications.

To begin, we establish the definition of a hypercube as a higher-dimensional analogue of a square or cube, with each additional dimension forming an orthogonal axis to the previous ones. This allows us to generalize the Pythagorean theorem to higher dimensions, where the sum of the squares of the lengths of the edges of a hypercube equals the square of its diagonal length. Using this formula, we derive the formula for the volume of a hypercube, which is given by the product of its edge lengths raised to the power of the number of dimensions.

Next, we investigate the Pythagorean powers of hypercubes, which involve expressing the diagonal length of a hypercube as an integer multiple of its edge length using Pythagorean triples. We explore the relationship between hypercubes and Pythagorean triples in detail, noting that only certain hypercube dimensions can have Pythagorean powers.

3379,15097.0,"The absorption of X-rays by the intergalactic medium (IGM) provides important insight into the physical properties, distribution, and evolution of the matter within the IGM. In this paper, a numerical study of X-ray absorption by the low-redshift IGM is performed using the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The analysis is based on a large-scale simulation of the IGM using a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation code that incorporates radiative transfer of ionizing radiation from galaxies and quasars.

The results show that the X-ray absorption cross section of the IGM increases rapidly with decreasing X-ray energy, and the absorption is dominated by photoionization of He-like and H-like ions. Furthermore, the IGM temperature and density have a strong impact on the X-ray absorption, with the absorption decreasing at higher temperatures and densities. A comparison of the simulation results with observations of the X-ray background radiation suggests that the contribution of the IGM to the diffuse X-ray background is significant and may account for a significant fraction of the observed excess.

They used a really advanced computer program to simulate what happens in the IGM, taking into account how light from galaxies and quasars affects it.

Key findings reveal that as X-ray energy decreases, absorption increases rapidly, mainly due to photoionization of He-like and H-like ions. Plus, the temperature and density of the IGM play a crucial role‚Äîhigher temps and densities lead to less absorption. üìâ 

When comparing simulation results with actual X-ray background radiation, it appears the IGM significantly contributes to the observed excess! This research not only validates the Lambda CDM model but also sets the stage for future studies using X-ray absorption to explore the IGM further. üå† This work enhances our understanding of the IGM's role in the universe's evolution and structure formation. #Astrophysics #XRayAbsorption #IntergalacticMedium #Cosmology","Hey! So, like, the way X-rays get absorbed by the intergalactic medium (IGM) is super important for figuring out the physical stuff, where it is, and how it changes over time in the IGM. This paper does a numerical study on X-ray absorption in the low-redshift IGM using the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. They used a big simulation of the IGM with this fancy hydrodynamic code that also looks at how ionizing radiation from galaxies and quasars gets transferred.

The findings show that the X-ray absorption cross section for the IGM goes up really fast when the X-ray energy goes down, and most of the absorption comes from photoionization of He-like and H-like ions. Plus, the temp and density of the IGM really affect the X-ray absorption, with it dropping at higher temps and densities. When they compared the simulation results to the actual X-ray background radiation, it looks like the IGM plays a big role in that diffuse X-ray background and might explain a good chunk of the extra stuff we see.

These simulation results are super useful for looking into the physical properties and how matter is spread out in the low-redshift IGM. They show that the Lambda CDM model can match what we see in the IGM and set up a way for future studies to use X-ray absorption as a tool. Overall, this research helps us get a better grip on how the IGM fits into the universe's evolution and structure formation.","The absorption of X-rays by the intergalactic medium (IGM) offers critical insights into the physical characteristics, distribution, and evolution of matter within the IGM. This document presents a numerical investigation of X-ray absorption in the low-redshift IGM, utilizing the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. The analysis is grounded in a large-scale simulation of the IGM, employing advanced hydrodynamic simulation software that integrates the radiative transfer of ionizing radiation from galaxies and quasars.

Findings indicate that the X-ray absorption cross section of the IGM increases significantly as X-ray energy decreases, with photoionization of He-like and H-like ions being the primary contributors to absorption. Additionally, the temperature and density of the IGM significantly influence X-ray absorption, with higher temperatures and densities leading to reduced absorption. A comparison between simulation outcomes and observations of the X-ray background radiation implies that the IGM plays a substantial role in the diffuse X-ray background, potentially accounting for a considerable portion of the observed excess.

The results from the numerical simulation serve as a valuable resource for examining the physical properties and distribution of matter in the low-redshift IGM. They demonstrate that the Lambda CDM model effectively replicates the observed characteristics of the IGM and establishes a foundation for future investigations of the IGM through X-ray absorption diagnostics.

4951,40509.0,"Fire is a chemical reaction that involves the combination of fuel, oxygen, and heat. When these three things come together, a flame is created and the fuel is burned. The weight of the fire itself is actually very small, since it is just a collection of gases and particles that are produced when the fuel burns.

However, the fuel that is being burned does have a weight. For example, if you were to burn a piece of wood in a fireplace, the wood would have a certain weight before it was burned. As the wood burns, it would release gases and particles into the air, and the weight of the wood would decrease. The weight of the fire itself would be very small compared to the weight of the wood, but the overall process of burning the wood would cause the weight of the fuel to decrease.

Conversely, the fuel undergoing combustion possesses a measurable weight. For instance, when a piece of wood is incinerated in a fireplace, it has a specific weight prior to combustion. As the wood burns, it emits gases and particles into the atmosphere, leading to a reduction in the weight of the wood. Although the weight of the fire is negligible in comparison to that of the wood, the act of burning the wood results in a decrease in the weight of the fuel.

He noted, ""It is entirely reasonable to highlight the absence of a cancer drugs fund in Wales and the record-low ambulance response times."" He emphasized the dilemma facing voters in the upcoming May elections: whether to support the Conservative party, which aims to protect health funding, or to endorse a party that has significantly reduced health services in Wales.

Conversely, Vaughan Gething, the Deputy Health Minister for Welsh Labour, accused the Conservatives of seeking to privatize the NHS. ""The Tories have had three opportunities during the campaign to categorically rule out NHS privatization, yet they have declined to do so,"" he stated. He further asserted, ""This election presents a clear choice between a Labour government committed to investing in the NHS to train an additional 1,000 doctors, nurses, and frontline staff, and a Conservative government that would impose a tablet tax on the sick and privatize health services.""

On a different note, during her campaign in mid Wales, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams pledged to enhance rural healthcare. Ms. Williams expressed her party's intention to invest in cottage hospitals and community care, stating, ""An urgent care center in Montgomeryshire is crucial for alleviating pressure on A&E departments and reducing waiting times."" 

Plaid Cymru criticized its opponents for neglecting the economy of north Wales.

You can also make your own speed slower if you want; programs like uTorrent even let you set a schedule for the whole week. When you're connected to a bunch of people, and they keep changing their speeds, your speed is going to go up and down a lot. 

Even when you're downloading from places like Rapidshare, the speed can change because Rapidshare has a limit on how fast it can go. If too many people are using the same server, it can slow down for everyone. You can't really tell how many people are using it or what files they have, so it feels random. Plus, if your neighborhood is using a lot of internet, the speed gets shared between everyone, which can make it slower for you.

When one of your peers initiates a full-speed download, they are allocated a specific bandwidth.

Additionally, users have the option to limit their own download speeds; for instance, uTorrent offers a scheduling feature for the entire week. Given that you are connected to approximately twenty peers, the constant changes in these parameters will lead to significant variations in speed.

Moreover, fluctuations in speed can also occur when downloading from services such as RapidShare, as these platforms impose their own speed quotas. If the quota for a particular server is exceeded, the download speeds for that server will decrease. The unpredictability of the number of users connected to a specific server, as well as the files being served, contributes to the perception that these fluctuations occur randomly. Furthermore, your local network has its own bandwidth limitations; if these limits are surpassed, the available speed is divided among you and your neighbors.

It is important to clarify that this discussion does not pertain to net neutrality or throttling, but rather to throughput caps. Net neutrality involves the prioritization of data during peak usage times, ensuring that your data is given precedence over others.

Results indicate that these scaling rules vary considerably from the typical behavior seen in bulk graphene. Notably, the resistivity in graphene nanostructures is influenced by factors such as edge roughness, chirality, and the width of the structure. Suitable models have been created to elucidate these observations, and their accuracy has been validated through simulations. This research enhances the comprehension of the electrical characteristics of graphene nanostructures and opens new avenues for the design of electronic devices at the nanoscale.","Research has been conducted on how edge effects influence the scaling rules for resistance in graphene nanostructures.

1250,82.0,"England made only 134-8 despite being well set on 50-1 after six overs, Jos Buttler top-scoring with 32 not out while spinner Imran Tahir took 4-21.
The hosts needed 15 runs from the final over and two off the last delivery.
Chris Morris scampered two as bowler Reece Topley failed to collect Joe Root's throw from long-off.
Morris, who also produced a match-winning 62 off 38 balls in the fourth one-day international, finished with 17 not out off seven balls.
The defeat was England's fourth in a row following their 3-2 reverse in the one-day series, but only their first loss in seven Twenty20 internationals.
The second game of the two-match series takes places in Johannesburg on Sunday.
That will be England's last competitive match before their opening game of the World Twenty20 on 16 March.
England knew they needed wickets to have any chance of winning and their hopes were boosted when Chris Jordan (3-23) dismissed AB de Villiers cheaply and Ben Stokes (1-19) removed Hashim Amla for 22 in a wicket-maiden.
Adil Rashid claimed the wicket of JP Duminy and fellow spinner Moeen Ali struck twice, including the wicket of top scorer Faf du Plessis for 25, to make the hosts nervous.
David Miller hit a six and a four in the 18th over but Jordan had him caught on the boundary and bowled David Wiese via an inside edge in a superb penultimate over that cost only six runs.
After Kyle Abbott ran a single off the first ball of the final over, Morris struck successive full tosses from Topley for four and six.
However, a dot ball was followed by two to long-off, leaving Morris on strike for the last delivery of the game.
Root's throw on the bounce was accurate but Topley, at the non-striker's end, fumbled the ball with Morris short of his ground.
Had Topley completed the run-out, the game would have gone to a super over.
Alex Hales helped get England off to a promising start with the bat but became Tahir's first wicket when he was caught for 27, Duminy taking a high catch despite team-mate Kagiso Rabada almost rugby-tackling him in a race for the ball.
Three balls later Root fell for eight to Wiese's first delivery and Stokes was stumped off Tahir the ball after hitting a muscular six.
Tahir then dismissed Morgan for 10 and Moeen first ball, and came within a whisker of a hat-trick as Jordan was beaten by a googly that went between bat and pad.
Helped by the accurate Wiese, who conceded only 19 off four overs, South Africa allowed only one boundary between the start of the eighth over and the end of the 14th.
England's 100 came up in 16th over but with Buttler restrained by the circumstances, they were unable to set the total they would have desired.
South Africa are now unbeaten in their past 13 matches against England at Newlands - a run that goes back to January 1957.
They have won 10 and drawn three matches, having played six Tests, five ODIs and two T20s.
England captain Eoin Morgan: ""After a pretty poor batting display our bowlers nearly pulled it out of the bag.
""Stokes and Jordan got as much as they could out of the pitch. The more and more we play the more responsibility the bowlers take on their shoulders.
""We created chances with an under-par score. That is a huge positive.
""We have had a reasonably good run in T20s and probably should have won tonight when we didn't deserve to.""
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""That's a massive get-out-of-jail card.
""Neither team played their best because the wicket was two-paced and not a normal T20 wicket, but I have a smile on my face because we won.
""We didn't start well. Twenty20 cricket is all about executing plans and we let them get away at the start. Our bowlers came back by getting wickets.

In the last over, England needed 15 runs, and they had to get 2 runs from the very last ball. Chris Morris ran really fast and got 2 runs because the bowler, Reece Topley, couldn't catch the throw from Joe Root.

3180,17020.0,"In this paper we study the orbital weak-field susceptibility of two-dimensional diffusive mesoscopic systems. For the previously unstudied regime of temperatures lower than the mean level spacing we find unexpected strong temperature as well as statistical ensemble dependence of the average and typical susceptibilities. An explanation for these features is given in terms of the long tail of the zero-temperature susceptibility distribution, including the parametric form of the temperature dependence. For temperatures higher than the mean level spacing we calculate the difference between the true canonical ensemble and the effective grand-canonical ensemble. We also perform numerical simulations, which seem to generally confirm previous theoretical predictions for this regime of temperatures, although some difficulties arise.

The important role of gauge-invariance, especially how it renders Random Matrix Theory inapplicable to the study of orbital susceptibility, is discussed. We conclude by considering interaction effects, giving a new interpretation to previous results as well as demonstrating the influence of in-plane magnetic field on the interaction-induced orbital response.",0,"In this paper, we look at how two-dimensional systems that are a bit messy respond to weak magnetic fields. We found something surprising: when the temperature is really low, the way these systems react depends a lot on the temperature and the type of group we are looking at. We explain this by talking about how the reactions change when it's super cold. When the temperature is higher, we compare two different ways of looking at the systems and see how they are different. We also did some computer tests that mostly matched what we thought would happen, but we ran into some problems too.

We talk about why it's important to keep certain rules in mind, especially because they make it hard to use a certain theory called Random Matrix Theory to study how these systems react to magnetic fields. Finally, we think about how interactions between particles change things and show how a magnetic field that goes sideways affects how these interactions work.","In this paper, we investigate the orbital weak-field susceptibility of two-dimensional diffusive mesoscopic systems. In the previously unexplored regime of temperatures below the mean level spacing, we observe an unexpected strong dependence of both the average and typical susceptibilities on temperature and statistical ensemble. We provide an explanation for these phenomena by examining the long tail of the zero-temperature susceptibility distribution, which includes the parametric form of the temperature dependence. For temperatures exceeding the mean level spacing, we compute the difference between the true canonical ensemble and the effective grand-canonical ensemble. Additionally, we conduct numerical simulations that generally corroborate prior theoretical predictions for this temperature regime, although some challenges are encountered.

We discuss the significant role of gauge invariance, particularly its implications for the applicability of Random Matrix Theory in the analysis of orbital susceptibility. We conclude by exploring interaction effects, offering a new interpretation of previous findings and demonstrating the impact of an in-plane magnetic field on the interaction-induced orbital response.","üöÄ Exciting research alert! üöÄ We‚Äôve delved into the orbital weak-field susceptibility of 2D diffusive mesoscopic systems. üåå In a groundbreaking finding, we explored a previously uncharted temperature range below the mean level spacing, revealing surprising dependencies on temperature and statistical ensembles for average and typical susceptibilities. üîç Our analysis highlights the long tail of the zero-temperature susceptibility distribution and its temperature effects.

So, in this paper, we're looking at the orbital weak-field susceptibility in 2D diffusive mesoscopic systems. We found some pretty surprising stuff when we checked out temps lower than the mean level spacing.

We explain this by looking at the long tail of the zero-temp susceptibility distribution and how it changes with temp. 

When temps are higher than the mean level spacing, we figured out the difference between the real canonical ensemble and the effective grand-canonical ensemble.

(2) Now that I have more evidence, S may no longer be probable. (2a) So now, relative to what I know, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary, common sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody what I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly non-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based on high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a logical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks that sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning.

Judea Pearl [ 17] has recently been exploring the possibility. There are any number of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that probability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from logic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a distribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update that distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated distribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and decision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson [15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and infers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other statement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All of the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in probabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly that concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is of great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for what earlier logicians have called ""ampliative"" or ""inductive"" or ""scientific"" inference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than do the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called ""real rules of inference"". It is characteristic of any such logic or inference procedure that it can go wrong: that statements accepted at one point may be rejected at a later point. Research underlying the results reported here has been partially supported by the Signals Warfare Center of the United States Army.",0,"Okay, so here‚Äôs the deal: I have enough proof to think that something, let‚Äôs call it S, is likely to be true.

It‚Äôs a bit tricky because it can change. Not many people have used this idea of high probability to create a new kind of logic, but some people like Jane Nutter think it might be connected to this kind of reasoning.

Judea Pearl is also looking into this idea. There are some people who really love probability and think it can answer everything without needing logic. People like Cheeseman and Henrion think it‚Äôs smart to look at how likely different things are, change those chances when we get new information, and then use that to make decisions. There‚Äôs a slightly different way of doing this that Nilsson talks about, where you guess the chances of some things and then figure out the chances of other things.

2018) Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitters (LAEs) at z~2-6. We find typical stellar masses of 10$^{9.3\pm0.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and star formation rates (SFR) of SFR$_{SED}=4.4^{+10.5}_{-2.4}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr and SFR$_{Lya}=5.9^{+6.3}_{-2.6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, combined with very blue UV slopes of beta=-2.1$^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, but with significant variations within the population. M$_{UV}$ and beta are correlated in a similar way to UV-selected sources, but LAEs are consistently bluer. This suggests that LAEs are the youngest and/or most dust-poor subset of the UV-selected population. We also study the Lya rest-frame equivalent width (EW$_0$) and find 45 ""extreme"" LAEs with EW$_0>240$ A (3 $\sigma$), implying a low number density of $(7\pm1)\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.

However, $w_0$ is anti-correlated with M$_{UV}$ and stellar mass. Our results imply that sources selected as LAEs have a high Lya escape fraction (f$_{esc, Lya}$) irrespective of cosmic time, but f$_{esc, Lya}$ is still higher for UV-fainter and lower mass LAEs. The least massive LAEs ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) are typically located above the star formation ""Main Sequence"" (MS), but the offset from the MS decreases towards z~6 and towards $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$.

We found that these galaxies usually have a mass of about 10 billion times the mass of our Sun and they are making new stars at a rate of about 4.4 to 5.9 solar masses each year. They also have very blue light, which means they are different from other galaxies. This tells us that LAEs are probably the youngest and have less dust compared to other galaxies that we can see in the UV light. 

We also checked how strong the Lyman-alpha light is in these galaxies and found 45 of them that are super strong, which means they are pretty rare. Overall, we didn‚Äôt see much change in the strength of this light or in how spread out the galaxies are from when the universe was 6 billion years old to when it was 2 billion years old. However, the spread is less for galaxies that are brighter and heavier. Our findings suggest that LAEs can let out a lot of Lyman-alpha light no matter how old the universe is, but the fainter and lighter ones let out even more. The lightest LAEs are usually above a line we call the ""Main Sequence"" for star formation, but this changes a bit as we look back in time. In the end, our study shows that LAEs have stayed pretty much the same over time and that they are becoming more like other galaxies that are making stars as the universe gets older.","We investigate comprehensive rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared (FIR) data within the COSMOS field to ascertain the individual spectral energy distributions (SED) of approximately 4,000 Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitters (LAEs) identified in the SC4K catalog (Sobral et al. 2018) at redshifts ranging from z~2 to z~6.

However, the project suffered several delays, notably because of newts that had to be trapped and relocated.

Plans to dismantle the old bridge were postponed after foundation work on the new platforms took longer than expected.
It is the latest delay to the project which first got the go-ahead in January 2014 - work was due to start six months later.
However, the rare newts - a species protected by law - were found during a routine ecological site survey and work was ordered not to begin until they were removed.
Flooding concerns at the site delayed the project further, and again in February 2015 when even more newts were found, prompting some to question the species' rarity.
The delays ""disappointed"" local councillors and ""frustrated"" the then transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin.

Prime Minister Antonio Costa stated last week that the network was compromised due to damage to cables and communication towers caused by the fire, although he noted that temporary mobile antennas were deployed. 

These forest fires represent the most devastating in Portugal's history, resulting in 64 fatalities and 254 injuries. The Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has a troubled history, having been established in 2006 as a collaboration between the government and the private sector. The system malfunctioned during a rescue operation amid storms in January 2013 and was implicated in the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.","Civil protection officials have disclosed that rescuers faced significant challenges due to the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster. New information has surfaced regarding urgent calls for assistance that failed to reach the on-site commanders. In response, the government has initiated an investigation into the network's performance.

The fire ignited in the Pedr√≥g√£o Grande region on the afternoon of June 17, and it quickly became apparent that the emergency network, which depends on mobile antennas, was malfunctioning. The first incident occurred at 19:45 on June 17, when three individuals called the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that flames were encroaching on the structure. However, emergency services were unable to connect with the local command post or the deputy commander, as noted in a timeline from the civil protection authority (ANPC), which Portuguese media have referred to as a ""black box.""

Just five minutes later, officials were again unable to reach a command post to assist a father and son in distress a few kilometers away in Troviscais. These incidents, along with several others, have been documented throughout the night by the P√∫blico and Jornal de Not√≠cias websites. 

At 01:02 on June 18, the civil protection authority's log recorded a particularly harrowing entry regarding the deaths of 47 individuals on a stretch of the N-236 road, with thirty of the victims found in their vehicles. A district relief operations command requested assistance to address ""breakdowns in the Siresp network"" and to ""remove the deceased from the road, which was obstructing emergency response efforts.""

Unix and Linux are types of operating systems that are used to run computers. An operating system is a special type of software that helps you interact with the computer and use all of its features. Windows is also an operating system, but it is a little different from Unix and Linux. One way that Unix, Linux, and Windows are different is in the way they are built. Unix and Linux are built using a type of software called ""open source"" software, which means that anyone can look at the code that makes up the operating system and even make changes to it. This makes it easy for people to work together to improve the operating system and add new features. Windows, on the other hand, is built using ""closed source"" software, which means that only the company that made it can see the code and make changes. This means that it is a little harder for other people to contribute to the development of Windows. Another way that Unix, Linux, and Windows are different is in the way they look and feel. Unix and Linux often have a more simple and plain interface, while Windows usually has a more colorful and visually appealing interface. This is because the companies that make Unix, Linux, and Windows have different design philosophies and target different types of users. I hope that helps to explain the difference between Unix, Linux, and Windows in a way that is easy to understand! Let me know if you have any more questions.",1,"Okay! So, let me tell you about Unix, Linux, and Windows like I‚Äôm talking to a little kid. Unix and Linux are kinds of operating systems, which are like special programs that help you use a computer.

Allow me to elucidate the distinctions between Unix/Linux and Windows in a manner that is accessible to a young audience. Unix and Linux are classifications of operating systems utilized to operate computers. An operating system is a specialized form of software that facilitates interaction with the computer and enables the utilization of its various features. Windows is also an operating system; however, it differs somewhat from Unix and Linux. 

One notable difference among Unix, Linux, and Windows lies in their construction. Unix and Linux are developed using a type of software known as ""open source"" software, which permits anyone to examine the underlying code of the operating system and even modify it. This openness fosters collaboration among individuals to enhance the operating system and introduce new functionalities. Conversely, Windows is constructed using ""closed source"" software, which restricts access to the code to only the company that developed it, thereby making it more challenging for others to contribute to Windows' development.

Additionally, Unix, Linux, and Windows differ in their visual presentation and user experience. Typically, Unix and Linux feature a more straightforward and utilitarian interface, while Windows is characterized by a more vibrant and visually appealing design. This variance arises from the differing design philosophies of the companies that produce Unix, Linux, and Windows, as well as their targeted user demographics. I trust this explanation clarifies the differences between Unix, Linux, and Windows in an easily comprehensible manner. Should you have any further inquiries, please do not hesitate to ask.","üåü Let's break it down for the little ones! üåü

Bony, 28, managed only eight goals in 46 appearances for City - more than half of which came as a substitute - and spent last season on loan at Stoke.
His potential return to Wales could depend on the future of Swansea's top scorer last season, Fernando Llorente.
The 32-year-old, who is currently sidelined with an arm injury, has been a transfer target for Chelsea, having worked with the Premier League champions' manager, Antonio Conte, at Juventus.
Swansea have yet to receive a bid this summer for the Spain international, who scored 15 goals last season to help the Welsh club avoid relegation from the top flight.
The Swans did reject offers for Llorente during the January transfer window, and a move for Bony could be seen as insurance should Llorente leave.
Swansea signed England Under-21 striker Tammy Abraham on a season-long loan from Chelsea earlier this summer.
But with club record signing Borja Baston on loan at Malaga, the Swans could be short of forward options if Llorente was to leave.
Before Baston's arrival, Bony was Swansea's record signing when he joined from Vitesse Arnhem for ¬£12m in 2013.
He scored 34 goals in all competitions for the Swans before his move to City.
Bony's high wages at City were thought to be a stumbling block for a potential return to the Liberty Stadium, though Swansea could soon have more money if midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson joins Everton.",0,"The player from Ivory Coast left the Swans to join Manchester City in 2015 for a big amount of money, around ¬£28 million, and he signed a contract for four years. Bony, who is 28 years old, only scored eight goals in 46 games for City, and most of those goals were when he came on as a substitute. Last season, he played on loan at Stoke. 

If he comes back to Wales, it might depend on what happens with Swansea's best scorer from last season, Fernando Llorente. Llorente is 32 and hurt his arm, but Chelsea wants to buy him because he used to play with their manager, Antonio Conte, at Juventus. So far, Swansea hasn't gotten any offers for Llorente, who scored 15 goals last season to help the team stay in the top league. 

Swansea turned down offers for Llorente in January, and if he leaves, getting Bony back could be a good backup plan. This summer, Swansea also got a young striker named Tammy Abraham on loan from Chelsea. But since their record signing, Borja Baston, is on loan at Malaga, they might not have enough forwards if Llorente goes away. 

Before Baston came, Bony was the most expensive player Swansea ever bought when he came from Vitesse Arnhem for ¬£12 million in 2013. He scored 34 goals for the Swans before moving to City. Bony's high salary at City might make it hard for him to come back to Swansea, but if Gylfi Sigurdsson leaves to join Everton, Swansea could have more money.","The Ivorian departed from the Swans to join the Etihad Stadium in 2015, signing a four-year contract for a fee that could reach ¬£28 million.

His potential return to Wales may hinge on the future of Swansea's leading scorer from last season, Fernando Llorente. The 32-year-old, who is currently recovering from an arm injury, has attracted interest from Chelsea, having previously collaborated with the Premier League champions' manager, Antonio Conte, during their time at Juventus. Thus far, Swansea has not received any bids this summer for the Spanish international, who netted 15 goals last season, aiding the Welsh club in evading relegation from the top tier. The Swans had previously declined offers for Llorente during the January transfer window, and a move for Bony could serve as a precautionary measure should Llorente depart. Earlier this summer, Swansea secured England Under-21 striker Tammy Abraham on a season-long loan from Chelsea. However, with club record signing Borja Baston currently on loan at Malaga, the Swans may find themselves lacking in forward options if Llorente were to leave. Prior to Baston's acquisition, Bony held the title of Swansea's record signing when he transferred from Vitesse Arnhem for ¬£12 million in 2013, during which he scored 34 goals across all competitions for the Swans before his transfer to City. Bony's substantial wages at City were perceived as a potential obstacle to his return to the Liberty Stadium; however, Swansea may soon have increased financial resources if midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson completes a transfer to Everton.","üö® Transfer News Alert! üö® Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony made a move from the Swans to Etihad Stadium back in 2015 for a whopping ¬£28m on a four-year deal. ‚öΩÔ∏è At City, he netted just 8 goals in 46 games, with many coming off the bench, and spent last season on loan at Stoke.

His possible comeback to Wales might depend on what happens with Swansea's top scorer from last season, Fernando Llorente. Llorente, who's 32 and hurt his arm, is being eyed by Chelsea since he worked with their manager, Conte, at Juve. 

Swansea hasn't gotten any bids for the Spain international yet, even tho he scored 15 goals last season to help keep the team from getting relegated. They turned down offers for him in Jan, so if Llorente leaves, getting Bony could be a backup plan.

650,194.0,"He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary.
Later, his White House press secretary said it had been ""the largest audience to ever see an inauguration, period"".
On Saturday, millions in the US and around the world protested against Mr Trump's new administration.
The largest US rally was in the capital Washington, which city officials estimated to be more than 500,000-strong. By most estimates, it surpassed the crowd at Friday's inauguration.
The aim was mainly to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under threat from the new administration.
Mr Trump did not mention the protests during a bridge-building visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday but instead turned on the press.
He accused the media of inventing a feud between him and the intelligence community and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth"".
Mr Trump said TV footage and photos of his inauguration had painted an inaccurate picture.
""It looked like a million and a half people"" there on Friday, he said, rubbishing media reports that there were as few as 250,000 people.
He also said the crowd extended all the way back to the Washington Monument, although this claim is contradicted by aerial shots from the day.
Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer berated reporters at a news conference over photographs that had shown large, empty spaces during the ceremony.
""This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,"" he said in a fiery statement.
""These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm about the inauguration are shameful and wrong.""
In addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system said trips were down on previous inaugurations. Marketing firm Nielsen said television views in the US were less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations.
Mr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: ""There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well.""
Outgoing CIA chief John Brennan accused Mr Trump of ""a despicable display of self-aggrandisement"" over the statement at Langley.
""Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandisement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of agency heroes,"" his former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said in a statement carried by CNN.
""Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself.""
Last week, Mr Brennan called on Mr Trump to be more ""disciplined"" in what he said and warned him not to underestimate Russian intentions.
Mr Trump's visit had sought to mend relations with the intelligence community after weeks of doubting their conclusions about alleged Russian interference into the US election.
""I love you, I respect you,"" he said, adding that he was ""1,000%"" behind the spy agency.
Mr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.
Mr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world.
German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, writing in Bild newspaper on Sunday, warned that the world was headed ""for turbulent times.""
""With the election of Donald Trump, the world of the 20th century has definitely been overtaken,"" he said.",0,"He said that a lot of people were at the Washington Monument while he was talking at the US Capitol, even though pictures showed something different. Later, his press secretary said it was ""the biggest crowd ever to see an inauguration, no doubt about it."" 

On Saturday, millions of people in the US and around the world protested against Mr. Trump's new government. The biggest protest in the US was in Washington, D.C., where city officials thought there were more than 500,000 people. Most people thought that was more than the crowd at the inauguration the day before. The main reason for the protest was to support women's rights, which activists think are in danger with the new government.

Mr. Trump didn't talk about the protests when he visited the CIA in Virginia on Saturday. Instead, he got mad at the reporters. He said the media was making up a fight between him and the intelligence community and called reporters ""some of the most dishonest people ever."" He also said that the TV and photos from his inauguration made it look like there were a lot more people than there really were. He claimed it looked like a million and a half people were there, even though some reports said there were only about 250,000. He also said the crowd went all the way back to the Washington Monument, but pictures from above showed that wasn't true.

Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer got upset with reporters at a news conference because pictures showed a lot of empty space during the ceremony. He said, ""This was the biggest audience ever for an inauguration, both in person and around the world."" He thought it was wrong for people to say otherwise. 

Besides the pictures, Washington's Metro system said fewer people used it than in past inaugurations. A company called Nielsen said fewer people watched on TV than when Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan had their first inaugurations. Spicer didn't answer any questions but said, ""People talk about holding Donald Trump accountable, but we will hold the press accountable too.""

The outgoing CIA chief, John Brennan, said Mr. Trump was showing off in a bad way when he spoke at the CIA. His former deputy, Nick Shapiro, said Brennan was really upset and thought Trump should be ashamed. Last week, Brennan told Trump to be more careful with what he says and not to underestimate Russia.

Mr. Trump's visit was supposed to fix things with the intelligence community after he doubted their reports about Russia messing with the US election. He said, ""I love you, I respect you,"" and that he was","During his address at the United States Capitol, he asserted that the crowd had reached the Washington Monument, despite photographic evidence that contradicted this claim.

The primary objective of the protests was to emphasize women's rights, which activists believe are under threat from the new administration.

Mr. Trump did not address the protests during a visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday; instead, he directed his criticism towards the press. He accused the media of fabricating a conflict between himself and the intelligence community, labeling reporters as ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth."" Mr. Trump contended that television footage and photographs of his inauguration misrepresented the actual attendance, claiming, ""It looked like a million and a half people"" were present on Friday, dismissing media reports that suggested attendance was as low as 250,000. He also maintained that the crowd extended back to the Washington Monument, a statement that is contradicted by aerial images from the event.

Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer chastised reporters during a news conference regarding photographs that depicted significant empty spaces during the ceremony. He asserted, ""This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe,"" in a passionate statement. He further stated, ""These attempts to diminish the enthusiasm surrounding the inauguration are shameful and incorrect."" In addition to the photographic evidence, Washington's Metro system reported a decrease in ridership compared to previous inaugurations. The marketing firm Nielsen indicated that television viewership in the United States was lower than that of Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations. Mr. Spicer, who did not entertain questions, added, ""There has been considerable discussion in the media regarding the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I am here to assert that this responsibility is mutual. We will also hold the press accountable.""

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the inauguration's attendance, stating it was the largest ever, while also holding the press accountable. Former CIA Director John Brennan condemned Trump's comments as ""self-aggrandisement,"" urging him to be more disciplined.

1907,401.0,"Scientists believe kissing helps people judge the quality of a potential mate through taste, smell and fitness.
Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around.
Women were found to value kissing more highly in long-term relationships.
An online survey of 900 adults by the Oxford team, published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behaviour, showed that men and women who were more attractive or had more casual sex partners were more selective in choosing mates, and those groups valued kissing more highly.
This suggests that kissing helps in sizing up a potential partner, the study says.
Professor Robin Dunbar, from the department of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said courtship in humans was complex and involved a whole series of assessments before men and women decided to carry on their relationship.
""Initial attraction may include facial, body and social cues. Then assessments become more and more intimate as we go deeper into the courtship stages, and this is where kissing comes in.
""In choosing partners, we have to deal with the 'Jane Austen problem': How long do you wait for Mr Darcy to come along when you can't wait forever and there may be lots of you waiting just for him? At what point do you have to compromise for the curate?""
Prof Dunbar said that Jane Austen, whose works of romantic fiction included Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, realised that people were extremely good at assessing where they were in the ""mating market"" and pitching their demands accordingly.
""It depends what kind of poker hand you've been dealt.
""If you have a strong bidding hand, you can afford to be much more demanding and choosy when it comes to prospective mates,"" he said,
If kissing plays a part in selecting a partner then it also plays an important role before sex in short relationships and at a range of different times in committed relationships, the study found.
The study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships.
This may be because it plays a role in increasing feelings of affection and attachment among couples, the researchers suggest.
Previous research had found that women placed greater value on activities that strengthen long-term relationships because being pregnant and raising children is easier when two parents are present.
In another study in Human Nature, researchers from Oxford suggest that women's attitude to romantic kissing also depends on where in their menstrual cycle and their relationship they are.
Women valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.",0,"Scientists think that kissing helps people figure out if someone would be a good boyfriend or girlfriend by tasting, smelling, and seeing how fit they are. A study from Oxford University found that once people are dating, kissing helps keep them together. Women really like kissing when they are in long-term relationships.

In a survey with 900 adults, the Oxford team found that good-looking people or those who have a lot of casual partners are pickier about who they date, and they also think kissing is super important. This means kissing helps people decide if they want to be with someone.

Professor Robin Dunbar from Oxford said that dating is complicated and involves a lot of checking things out before deciding to stay with someone. At first, people look at how someone looks and acts, but as they get closer, they start to kiss.

He talked about a problem from a book by Jane Austen, where people wonder how long to wait for the perfect partner when there are many others around. If you have a good chance of finding someone great, you can be pickier.

The study also found that kissing is really important before having sex in short relationships and at different times in serious ones. Women especially value kissing in long-term relationships because it helps them feel closer to their partner.

Researchers think this is because kissing makes people feel more loving and connected. Other studies showed that women care more about things that help long-term relationships because it‚Äôs easier to raise kids when both parents are around.

Another study said that women‚Äôs feelings about kissing can change depending on their menstrual cycle and how long they‚Äôve been with someone.

The findings indicated that women place a higher significance on kissing within the context of long-term relationships.

An online survey involving 900 adults, conducted by the Oxford research team and published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, demonstrated that both men and women who were deemed more attractive or who had a greater number of casual sexual partners exhibited a more selective approach in mate selection, with these groups attributing greater importance to kissing. This implies that kissing plays a role in assessing a potential partner, according to the study.

Professor Robin Dunbar, affiliated with the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, noted that human courtship is intricate and encompasses a series of evaluations prior to the decision to continue a relationship. He stated, ""Initial attraction may encompass facial, bodily, and social cues. Subsequently, assessments become increasingly intimate as individuals progress through the stages of courtship, at which point kissing becomes significant.""

In the context of partner selection, Professor Dunbar referenced the ""Jane Austen problem,"" which pertains to the dilemma of how long one should wait for an ideal partner, such as Mr. Darcy, when time is limited and many others may also be vying for his attention. He questioned, ""At what juncture must one compromise for the curate?""

Professor Dunbar further remarked that Jane Austen, known for her romantic novels including Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, recognized that individuals possess a keen ability to evaluate their standing in the ""mating market"" and adjust their expectations accordingly. He elaborated, ""It depends on the quality of the 'poker hand' one has been dealt.

The study concluded that if kissing is instrumental in the selection of a partner, it also holds significant importance prior to sexual intimacy in short-term relationships and at various stages within committed relationships. The research highlighted that kissing is particularly valued by women in long-term partnerships, potentially due to its role in enhancing feelings of affection and attachment between couples.

1853,200.0,"In a Commons debate, the ex-Labour leader said Conservative plans to limit the voting powers of Scottish MPs on Commons laws would ""rip up"" hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure.
The SNP said the Conservatives wanted to create a ""quasi-English Parliament"".
But ministers said it was vital England was treated fairly as further powers were devolved to other parts of the UK.
At the end of the debate, Labour staged and won a vote in which the government abstained. And Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order to urge the government to allow more time for the matter to be considered.
The government believes bills applying exclusively to England should not become law without the explicit consent of MPs from English constituencies and it wants to change Commons rules known as standing orders to give them a ""decisive say"" during their passage.
Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.
Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent
Panic stations? From the point of view of the government whips this afternoon's emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws was really rather alarming.
The debate, so skilfully secured by Lib Dem ex Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael, produced a slightly pointless vote in which the Conservatives mostly abstained, but it brought all kinds of nasty tensions to the surface.
Conservative MPs are supposed to be signed up for EVEL under the terms of their manifesto, but there were clearly quite a few with doubts, some about the policy, many more about the process, which was Mr Carmichael's line of attack.

However, the plans came under sustained attack from Labour, SNP and Lib Dems in an urgent debate, secured by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.
MPs are due to debate and vote on the government's plans next week but Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the plans required more detailed consideration, arguably through primary legislation.
If MPs representing constituencies in England had a ""veto"" on certain legislation, it would breach the longstanding principle that MPs, no matter who they represented, were ""all equal"".
""To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible,"" he said.
""They are not entitled to use the UK Parliament as a proxy for an English Parliament.""
Assurances that the new system would be reviewed by MPs after a year were inadequate, he added, saying this would not be capable of ""putting a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out - we all know that is the political reality"".
But Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it was ""simply incorrect"" to claim some MPs would be prevented from debating and voting on certain legislation and would continue to exercise the same rights as they do now.
Pressed by Mr Miliband on ""what the meaning and definition"" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a ""simple test"" would be what things were devolved to Scotland.
Requiring bills to have the support of a ""double majority"" of the whole of the Commons and those MPs representing England would also help mitigate ""any resentment"" felt by English voters about the slower pace of devolution to England.
""It is of vital importance that English citizens of the UK, as we move to an extra layer of devolution to Scotland and Wales and devolve additional tax powers to Northern Ireland, that they think it is fair,"" he said.
""It is what we pledged to do in our manifesto. We set it out in detail, step by step by step. We are implementing these changes and keeping our promises. I think the people who elected us would expect nothing else.""
Mr Miliband said the Conservatives had the power to address the issue after winning the election but urged them to think again.
""Is this true to the traditions of Conservatism? No because the last thing you do is rip up hundreds of years of constitutional practice in a standing order vote just before the House goes into recess,"" he said.
""Doing this procedure in the way it is being proposed is an act of constitutional vandalism. It really is.""
The SNP said Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through the Barnett Formula used to allocate public spending to different nations of the UK.
""This not just English votes for English laws, this is English votes for Scottish laws,"" said Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire. ""It is totally and utterly unacceptable.""
He added: ""Why don't they just tattoo our foreheads 'Scottish' and then they would be able to identify us.""
And Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh said the move would not make any difference to the outcome of votes and urged ministers to omit laws which indirectly applied to Scotland, saying not to do so would be a ""gift"" to the SNP's independence campaign.
Responding to a question by an SNP MP on Monday, Mr Grayling said the only English-only measure during the last Parliament had been the Education Bill, and there were 13 Bills which applied to England and Wales.",0,"In a debate in the Commons, the old Labour leader said that the Conservative plan to limit how Scottish MPs can vote on laws would mess up a lot of rules that have been around for hundreds of years. The SNP said the Conservatives wanted to make a sort of ""mini-English Parliament."" But the ministers said it was really important to treat England fairly as more powers were given to other parts of the UK.

At the end of the debate, Labour had a vote and won, while the government didn‚Äôt vote. Conservative MP David Davis asked for more time to think about the issue. The government thinks that laws only for England shouldn‚Äôt be passed without the agreement of MPs from England, and they want to change the rules in the Commons to make sure English MPs have a big say in these laws.

Ministers believe this will fix a problem where Scottish MPs can vote on things like health and education in England, but English MPs can‚Äôt vote on similar things in Scotland, where those decisions are made differently. 

Mark D'Arcy, a BBC reporter, said that the government was worried about the debate on English Votes for English Laws. The debate was organized by Alistair Carmichael, a Lib Dem who used to be the Scottish secretary. The vote didn‚Äôt really change anything because most Conservatives didn‚Äôt vote, but it showed that there were some tensions.

Even though Conservative MPs were supposed to support the new plan, some were unsure about it. Labour, SNP, and Lib Dems all criticized the plans during the debate. MPs will talk and vote on the government‚Äôs plans next week, but Mr. Carmichael said they need to think about it more carefully, maybe even with new laws.

He said if English MPs could stop certain laws, it would go against the idea that all MPs are equal. He thought rushing the changes was risky and that the government shouldn‚Äôt use the UK Parliament like it was just for England. Commons Leader Chris Grayling said it wasn‚Äôt true that some MPs wouldn‚Äôt be able to vote on certain laws and that they would still have the same rights.

When Mr. Miliband asked what ""English-only"" laws meant, Mr. Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide, but he thought it would be based on what powers were given to Scotland. He also said that needing a ""double majority"" from all MPs and those from England would help with any anger English voters felt about how slowly things were changing for them.

Mr. Miliband said the Conservatives could fix the issue since they won the","During a debate in the House of Commons, the former Labour leader articulated that the Conservative Party's proposals to restrict the voting rights of Scottish Members of Parliament (MPs) on legislation in the Commons would effectively dismantle centuries of established parliamentary procedure. The Scottish National Party (SNP) contended that the Conservatives aimed to establish a ""quasi-English Parliament."" Conversely, government ministers asserted the necessity of ensuring equitable treatment for England as additional powers are devolved to other regions of the United Kingdom.

At the conclusion of the debate, the Labour Party organized and successfully executed a vote in which the government abstained. Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order, urging the government to allocate more time for deliberation on the issue. The government maintains that legislation applicable solely to England should not be enacted without the explicit consent of MPs representing English constituencies, and it seeks to amend the House of Commons rules, known as standing orders, to provide these MPs with a ""decisive say"" during the legislative process.

Ministers argue that this approach will rectify the longstanding inconsistency whereby Scottish MPs can vote on matters such as health and education that affect England, while English MPs lack a voice on similar issues concerning Scotland, where such policies are devolved. Mark D'Arcy, the BBC's Parliamentary correspondent, noted that the emergency Commons debate on English Votes for English Laws, orchestrated by former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, was a source of considerable concern for government whips. Although the debate resulted in a somewhat inconsequential vote, primarily featuring Conservative abstentions, it revealed underlying tensions within the party.

Despite Conservative MPs being expected to support the English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) initiative as outlined in their manifesto, many expressed reservations regarding both the policy and the procedural approach, which was the focus of Mr. Carmichael's critique. The proposals faced significant opposition from Labour, the SNP, and the Liberal Democrats during the urgent debate initiated by Mr. Carmichael.

MPs are scheduled to discuss and vote on the government's proposals in the following week; however, Mr. Carmichael, representing Orkney and Shetland, argued that the plans necessitate more thorough examination, potentially through primary legislation. He cautioned that granting MPs from English constituencies a ""veto"" over specific legislation would violate the long-standing principle of equality among MPs, regardless of their constituencies. He expressed concern that the government's expedited timeline for implementation posed an irresponsible risk, asserting that they should not utilize the UK Parliament as a substitute for an English Parliament.

","üö® In a heated Commons debate, former Labour leader slammed Conservative plans to limit Scottish MPs' voting rights, claiming it would ""rip up"" centuries of parliamentary tradition. The SNP accused the Tories of trying to create a ""quasi-English Parliament."" Meanwhile, ministers argued that fairness for England is crucial as more powers are devolved across the UK. 

Labour managed to stage a vote, with the government abstaining, while Conservative MP David Davis called for more time to discuss the issue. The government wants to ensure that bills affecting only England get the green light from English MPs, addressing the current imbalance where Scottish MPs can vote on English matters. 

However, the plans faced backlash from Labour, SNP, and Lib Dems, with Alistair Carmichael emphasizing the need for thorough consideration. Concerns were raised about the potential breach of the principle of equality among MPs. Commons Leader Chris Grayling defended the proposal, stating that all MPs would retain their rights. 

As the debate continues, the SNP highlighted that Scottish voters would still be impacted by English legislation, calling the situation ""totally unacceptable."" Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh warned that this move could inadvertently aid the SNP's independence campaign.

However, these fields face a common challenge - the need for a programming language that can support the modeling of complex cognitive and emotional processes in robots and autonomous systems. This paper explores the potential for using a common programming language to bridge the gap between these two fields, which often operate in parallel. In particular, we propose the adoption of a novel language, developed specifically for the purposes of robopsychology and robophilosophy, that could facilitate the integration of cognitive, emotional, and ethical reasoning in robots and other machines. We describe the key features of this language and provide examples of how it could be used in practice to model the psychological and social dimensions of robotic behavior, such as social learning, affective computing, and moral decision-making. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach offers promising opportunities for enhancing the capabilities of robots as social actors and facilitating new forms of human-robot interaction in everyday life.

3662,6210.0,"P. Broussous and S. Stevens studied maps between enlarged Bruhat-Tits buildings to construct types for p-adic unitary groups. They needed maps which respect the Moy-Prasad filtrations. That property is called (CLF), i.e.

compatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations. In the first part of this thesis we generalise their results on such maps to the Quaternion-algebra case.

Let k0 be a p-adic field of residue characteristic not two. We consider a semisimple k0-rational Lie algebra element beta of a unitary group G:=U(h) defined over k0 with a signed hermitian form h. Let H be the centraliser of beta in G. We prove the existence of an affine H(k0)-equivariant CLF-map j from the enlarged Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0). As conjectured by Broussous the CLF-property determines j, if none of the factors of H is k0-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all factors are unitary groups. Under the weaker assumption that the affine CLF-map j is only equivariant under the center of H^0(k0) it is uniquely determined up to a translation of B^1(H,k0). The second part is devoted to the decoding of embedding types by the geometry of a CLF-map. Embedding types have been studied by Broussous and M. Grabitz. We consider a division algebra D of finite index with a p-adic center F. The construction of simple types for GLn(D) in the Budhnell-Kutzko framework required an investigation of strata which had to fulfil a rigidity property. Giving a stratum especially means to fix a pair (E,a) consisting of a field extension E|F in Mn(D) and a hereditary order a which is stable under conjugation by E^x, in other words we fix an embedding of E^x into the normalizer of a. Broussous and Grabitz classified these pairs with invariants. We describe and prove a way to decode these invariants using the geometry of a CLF-map.",0,"P. Broussous and S. Stevens looked at special maps between big buildings called Bruhat-Tits buildings to help understand p-adic unitary groups. They needed these maps to follow certain rules called Moy-Prasad filtrations, which is also known as (CLF) or compatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations. In the first part of this paper, we take what they found and apply it to a different situation called the Quaternion-algebra case.

Let‚Äôs say k0 is a p-adic field that doesn‚Äôt have a residue characteristic of two. We are looking at a special kind of Lie algebra element called beta from a unitary group G:=U(h) that is based on k0 and has a signed hermitian form h. H is the part of G that keeps beta the same. We show that there is a special map j that goes from the big Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0) and follows the CLF rules. Broussous guessed that the CLF property helps to figure out j, especially if none of the parts of H are the same as the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all parts are unitary groups. If we only need the map j to follow the center of H^0(k0), then it can be determined in a special way, except it can be moved around a bit in B^1(H,k0). 

The second part of the paper talks about understanding embedding types using the shape of a CLF-map. Broussous and M. Grabitz studied these embedding types. We look at a division algebra D that has a p-adic center F. To create simple types for GLn(D) in a certain way, we had to check some special groups that needed to be really strong. To give a stratum means we need to choose a pair (E,a) that includes a field extension E|F in Mn(D) and a hereditary order a that stays the same when we change it with E^x. Broussous and Grabitz figured out how to classify these pairs with special markers. We explain and prove a way to understand these markers using the shape of a CLF-map.","P. Broussous and S. Stevens conducted a study on mappings between enlarged Bruhat-Tits buildings to develop types for p-adic unitary groups. Their research necessitated mappings that adhere to the Moy-Prasad filtrations, a characteristic referred to as compatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations (CLF). In the initial section of this thesis, we extend their findings regarding such mappings to the context of Quaternion algebras.

Let \( k_0 \) denote a p-adic field with a residue characteristic not equal to two. We examine a semisimple \( k_0 \)-rational Lie algebra element \( \beta \) of a unitary group \( G := U(h) \), which is defined over \( k_0 \) with a signed hermitian form \( h \). Let \( H \) represent the centralizer of \( \beta \) within \( G \). We establish the existence of an affine \( H(k_0) \)-equivariant CLF-map \( j \) from the enlarged Bruhat-Tits building \( B^1(H,k_0) \) to \( B^1(G,k_0) \). As conjectured by Broussous, the CLF property uniquely determines \( j \) provided that none of the factors of \( H \) is \( k_0 \)-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of \( k_0 \)-rank one and that all factors are unitary groups. Under the less stringent condition that the affine CLF-map \( j \) is merely equivariant under the center of \( H^0(k_0) \), it is uniquely determined up to a translation within \( B^1(H,k_0) \). 

The second section of this thesis is dedicated to the interpretation of embedding types through the geometry of a CLF-map. Embedding types have been previously examined by Broussous and M. Grabitz. We consider a division algebra \( D \) of finite index with a p-adic center \( F \). The formulation of simple types for \( GL_n(D) \) within the Budhnell-Kutzko framework necessitated an exploration of strata that must satisfy a rigidity condition. Defining a stratum specifically involves fixing a pair \( (E,a) \), where \( E|F \) is a field extension in \( M_n(D) \) and \( a \) is a hereditary order that remains stable under conjugation by \( E^x \);","üöÄ Exciting research alert! üìö P.

151,158.0,"Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.
But what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?
The best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.
Imagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.
They symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.
Lower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]
But the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.
In this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.
Take for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.
In the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.
In 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.
Solihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.
Extreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.
Like a collection of by-elections perhaps?
That may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.
And what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?
Or, about those ""percentage swing to win or lose"" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?
All it tells us is how little they tell us.
""Never assume"" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.
In an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.
In this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?",0,"In our part of the country, we usually have two main political parties, more than anywhere else. So, a simple tool that points one way or the other usually works just fine. But I wonder, how can we show all the different choices in 2015? 

I thought of a fun idea! Picture a needle hanging from a thread above a table with magnets of different strengths and colors arranged in a circle. These magnets represent how the parties interact in each area. If you lower the needle to the center, you can see which way it points. [Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not really going to do this! Not yet anyway!]

The cool thing is that the magnets would be different in each area. Now, every place is kind of its own little world when it comes to politics. For example, look at Dudley North and Solihull. In Dudley North, Labour has a tiny lead of just 649 votes. Last time, the Conservatives were their biggest competition, but now UKIP is really close behind them. 

In Solihull, the Conservatives want to win back the seat. The Liberal Democrats only had a small lead of 175 votes last time, but now the Green Party is becoming a big deal because of local issues. 

These two places show that even if UKIP or the Greens don‚Äôt win seats, they can still change how the main parties do in different areas. It‚Äôs like having a bunch of mini-elections! 

This election is a great chance for local news to look closely at what‚Äôs happening in each area and explain that the biggest parties might gain or lose seats in surprising ways. 

What does this mean for the big national polls that say there might be a hung Parliament, where the two biggest parties are close together, followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens? Or those stats about how many votes you need to win or lose, which were made when there were mostly two parties? 

It just shows us that those numbers don‚Äôt really tell us much. ""Never assume,"" said a famous cricket commentator named Richie Benaud. In such an unpredictable election, maybe thinking there will be a hung Parliament isn‚Äôt right. Maybe the real answers are in the smaller details. 

With all the surprises in this election, it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking at all if the final result is the biggest surprise of all!","The region in question has historically operated within a two-party system to a greater extent than any other area in the nation, thus a simple mechanism indicating one direction or another has typically sufficed for the task at hand. However, I find myself pondering what would be necessary to visualize the vast array of political dynamics present in 2015. 

The most viable concept I have devised thus far is as follows: envision a needle suspended from a thread above a table, upon which magnets of varying strengths and political affiliations are arranged in a circular formation. These magnets represent the interactions among the political parties within each constituency. As one lowers the needle towards the center of the table, one can observe its directional inclination. [Rest assured, BBC graphic designers, I am not seriously proposing to implement this idea‚Äîat least not at this juncture.]

The crucial aspect to note is that the composition and strength of the magnets would differ significantly from one constituency to another. In this era characterized by multi-party politics, each electoral seat operates with a degree of autonomy. 

For instance, consider two pivotal local marginal constituencies: Dudley North and Solihull. In the Black Country constituency, Labour is defending a slender majority of merely 649 votes. In the 2010 election, their closest competitors were the Conservatives; however, this time, it is UKIP, with nine seats on the local council, that poses a significant challenge to Labour. 

Solihull represents another critical target for the Conservatives, where the Liberal Democrats previously held a majority of just 175 votes. Since that election, the Green Party has emerged as a formidable presence in the area, propelled by a compelling combination of green belt and housing concerns. 

While these examples may be extreme, they underscore the notion that regardless of whether UKIP or the Greens succeed in securing seats or come close to doing so, their influence on the established parties will undoubtedly vary from one constituency to another. 

Could this be likened to a series of by-elections? Perhaps that is an exaggeration. Nevertheless, I am increasingly persuaded that this election presents regional and local broadcasters with a distinctive opportunity to delve into the local dynamics of individual constituencies and to elucidate the potential for gains and losses among the major parties. 

What implications does this have for the national poll ratings suggesting a hung Parliament, where the two largest parties appear to be in alignment, followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens? Furthermore, what can be inferred from the ""percentage swing to win or lose"" statistics that have been","In our region, politics has always been a two-party game, but as we look ahead to 2015, things are about to get a lot more interesting! ü§îüí≠ Imagine a needle suspended above a table surrounded by magnets of different strengths and political colors, representing the unique dynamics of each constituency.

These examples show that every seat is its own battleground, and the impact of smaller parties like UKIP and the Greens could shake things up in unexpected ways. üìä‚ú® 

As we gear up for this election, local broadcasters have a golden opportunity to dive deep into the unique stories of each constituency. With the potential for surprising gains and losses, we can't rely solely on national polls or traditional swing stats.

In this unpredictable election, the biggest surprise might just be the outcome itself! üó≥Ô∏èüí• #Election2015 #Politics #LocalDynamics","Hey!

The key thing is that the magnets‚Äô types and strengths would totally vary from one area to another. In this multi-party era, every seat kinda has its own vibe. 

Take Dudley North and Solihull, for example. In Dudley, Labour‚Äôs holding onto a tiny majority of just 649. Back in 2010, the Conservatives were their main rivals, but now UKIP is right on their tail with nine local council seats. 

Then there‚Äôs Solihull, a big target for the Conservatives. Last time, the Lib Dems had a slim majority of just 175, but now the Green Party is making waves with all the green belt and housing stuff going on. 

These two places show that whether UKIP or the Greens actually win seats or not, they‚Äôll still shake things up for the main parties differently in each area. Kinda like a bunch of by-elections, maybe? 

That might be a stretch, but I really think this election gives local broadcasters a cool chance to dig into the local dynamics of each seat and show that gains and losses could go either way among the big parties. 

And what does that say about those national polls hinting at a hung Parliament, with the two main parties neck and neck, followed by UKIP, the Lib Dems, and the Greens? Or those ‚Äúpercentage swing to win or lose‚Äù stats that are based on a mostly two-party scene? 

Honestly, it just shows how little they really mean. ‚ÄúNever assume,‚Äù as the late cricket commentator Richie Benaud used to say. In such an unpredictable election, maybe the ideas about a hung Parliament are off. The real answers might be in the smaller details. 

With all the unexpected twists in this race, how shocking would it be if the final result turned out to be the biggest surprise of all?","The region in question has historically operated within a two-party system more than any other area in the nation, making a simple directional indicator typically sufficient for analysis.

These magnets represent the interactions among parties in each constituency. By lowering the needle towards the center, one could observe its directional inclination. [Note: This is a hypothetical scenario and not a proposal for actual implementation at this time.]

The key takeaway is that the composition and strength of the magnets would vary significantly from one constituency to another. In this multi-party political era, each seat operates independently. 

For instance, consider two pivotal local marginal seats: Dudley North and Solihull. In Dudley North, Labour is defending a slim majority of just 649 votes, with UKIP now posing a significant challenge, having gained nine seats on the local council since 2010. Conversely, Solihull is a critical target for the Conservatives, where the Liberal Democrats previously held a narrow majority of 175. The Green Party has emerged as a formidable presence in Solihull, driven by local issues related to green spaces and housing.

While these examples may be extreme, they illustrate that regardless of whether UKIP or the Greens secure seats, their influence will vary across constituencies, impacting established parties differently. 

This situation resembles a series of by-elections, albeit perhaps an exaggeration.

It indicates that these metrics provide limited insight. As the late cricket commentator Richie Benaud advised, ""Never assume."" In such an unpredictable election, assumptions regarding a hung Parliament may be questionable. The answer may lie not in the broader picture but in the specifics.

Economists had expected the economy to suffer from the government's decision to withdraw high-denomination banknotes as part of an anti-corruption drive.
The federal statistics office retained its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2017 at 7.1%.
The figures surprised economists, who had expected the economy to take a bigger hit from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision last November to withdraw old 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee banknotes, taking 86% of the currency out of circulation virtually overnight.
""Perhaps this data is not capturing the impact of demonetisation,"" said Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance.
""I am totally surprised and stunned to see this number... I believe that, with a lag, we will see an impact on GDP numbers.""
Saugata Bhattacharya, a chief economist at Axis Bank, said ""big rises"" in agriculture and manufacturing ""show that the impact from demonetisation on growth has been less than expected"".
However, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Holdings, said the current year's growth ""appears to be overstated as our National Accounts Statistics does not adequately capture activities from the unorganised sector"".
""While the numbers make sense in terms of direction of change, their actual magnitude appears to be overstated,"" she said.

Economists were worried that the economy would struggle because the government decided to take away big money notes to fight corruption. The federal statistics office still thinks the economy will grow by 7.1% by March 2017. 

This news surprised a lot of economists because they thought the economy would be hurt more by Prime Minister Modi's choice last November to take away old 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, which took away 86% of the money really fast. Aneesh Srivastava, who works at IDBI Federal Life Insurance, said he was shocked by the numbers and thinks we might see the real effects of taking away the money later on. 

Saugata Bhattacharya, a chief economist at Axis Bank, said that the big increases in farming and making things show that the effects of taking away the money weren't as bad as they thought. But Rupa Rege Nitsure, who is a chief economist at L&T Holdings, said that the growth numbers might be too high because they don‚Äôt really show what‚Äôs happening with informal workers.

These figures took economists by surprise, as they had predicted a more significant impact on the economy following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision last November to eliminate old 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee banknotes, which effectively removed 86% of the currency from circulation almost instantaneously.

The reason it's *better* to use the frame/ground (instead of the straight negative terminal), is because there's a very small chance (even smaller in more modern batteries), to ignite hydrogen gas that car batteries can leak (pretty rarely). When connecting to the frame/ground, the spark is further away from the battery which reduces the chance to ignite any hydrogen gas.    tl;dr - Negative to negative is fine and not ""wrong"", it's just less safe than negative to frame/ground (the farther from the battery the better).",0,"When you connect things to a car battery, you can hook up the negative part to the battery or to the car's frame, which is called ground. The reason it's safer to use the frame is that sometimes car batteries can leak a tiny bit of hydrogen gas, and if you connect to the battery directly, there's a small chance that a spark could make it go boom! But if you connect to the frame, the spark is farther away from the battery, so it's less likely to cause any trouble. So, connecting to the battery is okay, but connecting to the frame is a better idea because it keeps you safer!","The connection of the negative terminal to the ground is a common practice. Are you aware of the rationale behind this? Connecting negative to negative operates in an identical manner, as the negative terminal of a car battery is indeed grounded to the vehicle's frame. The primary advantage of utilizing the frame or ground instead of directly connecting to the negative terminal lies in the minimal risk‚Äîthough even less so with more contemporary batteries‚Äîof igniting hydrogen gas that may occasionally escape from car batteries. By connecting to the frame or ground, the potential spark is positioned further away from the battery, thereby diminishing the likelihood of igniting any hydrogen gas. In summary, while connecting negative to negative is acceptable and not incorrect, it is comparatively less safe than connecting to the frame or ground, as maintaining a greater distance from the battery is preferable.","üîåüí° Did you know? When connecting a car battery, going negative to ground is actually safer! üöó‚ú® While negative to negative works just fine, the negative terminal is grounded to the frame. Using the frame reduces the risk of igniting any hydrogen gas that might leak from the battery (which is super rare, especially in newer models).

Connecting to the frame/ground is preferred over directly connecting to the negative terminal because it minimizes the risk of igniting hydrogen gas that may occasionally leak from the battery.

By connecting to the frame/ground, the spark is positioned further from the battery, thereby reducing the risk of ignition. In summary, while connecting negative to negative is acceptable, it is considered less safe than connecting to the frame/ground, as greater distance from the battery is advantageous.","When connecting a car battery, using the negative terminal is fine, but connecting to the frame or ground is safer. This is because the negative terminal is grounded to the car's frame. The main reason for this preference is that car batteries can occasionally leak hydrogen gas, which is flammable.

Researchers at Cardiff University found students were 15% less likely to achieve a first or 2:1 degree.
The Welsh government said the Bacc will be more rigorous from September 2015, and it will address many findings in the report, which it commissioned.
The Welsh Bacc brings together traditional qualifications like GCSEs and A-levels with the Bacc ""core,"" comprised of a range of modules including team enterprise activities, community participation and Wales' place in Europe and the world.
There are currently more than 78,000 learners registered on Welsh Baccalaureate courses studying at more than 250 schools and other institutions.
""Participation and progress are kind of connected,"" Prof Chris Taylor from Cardiff University, a co-author of the report, told BBC Radio Wales.
""On the one hand you'll find that students are significantly more likely to get into university with the Welsh Baccalaureate. Crucially, they are more likely to get into a leading Russell Group university, which is very good news.
""However that seems to come at the expense then in terms of their successes of degree outcomes.
""Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1.""
He added: ""The number of students who are not likely to get a good degree isn't as significantly as large as we first thought.""
Prof Taylor said the Welsh Bacc's success in terms of getting students into university ""far outweighs"" the disadvantages found in terms of their results.
But he said: ""We do make the recommendation that it could be more challenging. It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study.
""We also recognise there needs to be greater support for the qualification because it has some added value.
""There are clearly some benefits to some students in terms of essay writing skills, in terms of time management and independent learning that most other qualifications don't offer.
""But it doesn't translate in terms of degree results and that may be because it's at the expense of subject knowledge which is missing.""
""On the one hand it's a core qualification that every student should undertake and it provides a set of core skills that everybody like employers, labour markets and higher education universities can understand is there but at the same time it's got to be challenging, got to be tailored to the individual needs of students.
""That challenge is very difficult for sixth forms and FE colleges.""
Last year, a study by the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) also suggested undergraduates completing the Welsh Bacc fare less well at university than those who have not.
The Welsh government said the research by Cardiff University was commissioned to help with the development of the Welsh Bacc.
A spokesperson added: ""Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate.
""As a result, we are working towards delivering a more rigorous Welsh Baccalaureate to be taught from September 2015.
""This will provide further assurance to higher education institutions about the ability of Welsh Baccalaureate learners and will help university admissions tutors make offers to prospective learners.""",0,"The Welsh Baccalaureate, or Bacc, started about ten years ago to help students learn more things. A study from Cardiff University found that students with the Bacc were 15% less likely to get a top degree. The Welsh government said they will make the Bacc harder starting in September 2015 to fix some of the problems found in the study they asked for.

The Welsh Bacc combines regular qualifications like GCSEs and A-levels with a special ""core"" that includes different activities like working in teams, helping the community, and learning about Wales' role in Europe and the world. Right now, over 78,000 students are taking Welsh Bacc courses in more than 250 schools and places.

Professor Chris Taylor from Cardiff University, who helped write the report, told BBC Radio Wales that getting into university and doing well are connected. He said students with the Welsh Bacc are more likely to get into university, especially good ones, which is great news. But, it seems like those students might not do as well in their degrees compared to students without the Bacc.

He mentioned that the number of students who might not get a good degree isn't as big as they first thought. He believes that the Bacc helps students get into university, which is a big plus, but it could be made tougher and more suited to what students want to study in college.

Professor Taylor also said that students need more help with the Bacc because it has some good parts, like helping with writing essays, managing time, and learning on their own, which other qualifications might not teach. But, this doesn't always help with getting good degree results, maybe because students miss out on important subject knowledge.

He thinks the Bacc is important for all students to take because it teaches skills that employers and universities like, but it also needs to be challenging and fit what each student needs. This can be hard for schools and colleges to do.

Last year, another study showed that students who finish the Welsh Bacc might not do as well in university as those who don‚Äôt. The Welsh government said they asked Cardiff University to do this research to help improve the Bacc. They also said they are already working on making the Bacc better based on the findings from the studies, and they want to make sure that universities can trust that students with the Bacc are ready for college.","The Welsh Baccalaureate was introduced approximately ten years ago to provide a more comprehensive educational experience.

However, this advantage appears to come at the cost of their degree outcomes. Our findings indicate that students who do not possess the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to achieve a first-class or 2:1 degree.""

He further noted, ""The proportion of students unlikely to secure a good degree is not as substantial as initially perceived."" Professor Taylor emphasized that the Welsh Baccalaureate's effectiveness in facilitating university admissions ""far outweighs"" the identified drawbacks concerning academic results. Nonetheless, he recommended that the program could be made more challenging and better tailored to meet the specific subject choices of students pursuing higher education.

Additionally, he acknowledged the necessity for enhanced support for the qualification, given its added value. ""There are evident benefits for certain students in areas such as essay writing, time management, and independent learning, which are not typically offered by other qualifications.

3891,5863.0,"Pygmy resonances are a phenomenon observed in atomic nuclei which have garnered a great deal of attention over the past few decades. Despite their name, which could imply their diminutive size, pygmy resonances are quite complex and offer insight into the characteristics of the nucleus beyond the more traditionally studied giant resonances. 

While pygmy resonances were initially thought to only be low-energy modes in the excitation spectrum, recent studies have revealed their potential to serve as sensitive probes for the nature of the nuclear force. Furthermore, they may even have implications for astrophysical phenomena and the synthesis of elements in supernovae.

However, despite the interest in pygmy resonances, the name itself has been subject to criticism. Some argue that the name is too colloquial and trivializes the complexity of these resonances, while others point out that the term ""pygmy"" has a colonial connotation which is inappropriate in modern academic contexts. One proposal has been to rename pygmy resonances as ""soft resonances"", which has gained some traction in the community.

This paper aims to explore the controversies surrounding the name of pygmy resonances and evaluate whether a name change is necessary or appropriate. Through a review of literature and interviews with researchers in the field, we assess the arguments for and against renaming these resonances. We also consider the potential impacts of a name change on the scientific community and the general public's perception of nuclear physics research.

In conclusion, while pygmy resonances have provided valuable insights into our understanding of atomic nuclei, the name itself raises important questions about language and equity in science. Our evaluation suggests that a name change may be warranted, and we recommend ""soft resonances"" as a more fitting and inclusive term.",1,"Pygmy resonances are something scientists have been studying in atomic nuclei for a long time. Even though the name makes it sound small, these resonances are actually pretty complicated and help us learn more about the nucleus, especially compared to the bigger resonances that are usually studied.

This paper looks at the arguments about whether we should change the name of pygmy resonances. We read a lot of research and talked to scientists to see what they think about renaming them. We also thought about how changing the name might affect how people see nuclear physics.

1621,157.0,"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.
It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.
They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park.
The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans.
It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.
The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.""
If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill.
The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage.
The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition.
However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations.
Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site.
Earlier this year plans for an eight turbine wind farm next to the mine were submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.",0,"Some people who make energy say that a big project called the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, close to a place called Kirckconnel, could make power for over 100 years! This is part of a bunch of new energy ideas for the area, which is owned by a company called Buccleuch Estates. They want to turn an old mine into something called Glenmuckloch Energy Park.

The information about this project came from a report that was sent to the Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates is working with a mining company called Hargreaves and another company called 2020 Renewables to make these plans. They want to build two big water ponds, one higher up than the other, and they will be connected by a tunnel with a special pump.

The report explains that when there is too much electricity, the pump will move water to the upper pond. But when more electricity is needed, the pump will switch and let the water flow back down to make power. If everything goes as planned, the lower pond will be made from the old mine hole, and the upper pond will be dug out at the top of Halfmerk Hill. The upper pond will be really deep, about 22 meters (which is like 72 feet), and it will hold a lot of water, about 3.3 million cubic meters!

This project is happening because a mining company called Aardvark TMC went out of business in 2013, and they didn‚Äôt have enough money to fix the area. But since then, Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have been working to fix things while still doing some mining. Later this summer, they will also build two wind turbines for the community near the hydro site. Earlier this year, they even asked the council if they could build an eight-turbine wind farm next to the mine!","Developers assert that the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, located near Kirkconnel, has the potential to generate electricity for over a century. This initiative is the most recent in a series of renewable energy projects proposed for the site, which is under the ownership of Buccleuch Estates. These projects are part of a broader effort to transform the opencast mine into the Glenmuckloch Energy Park. 

The specifics of the project have been outlined in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme, which has been submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. Buccleuch Estates has collaborated with the mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to develop these plans. The project will entail the construction of two reservoirs‚Äîone situated at a higher elevation than the other‚Äîconnected by a tunnel featuring a pump-turbine system. 

According to the report, ""When excess electricity exists within the grid, the pump-turbines operate in pumping mode, transferring water to the upper pond. Conversely, when demand within the network surpasses the available supply, the pump-turbines reverse their operation and switch to generating mode, releasing water from the upper pond.""

An external investigation has uncovered ""serious"" inaccuracies in the council's air quality data from that period, which made the pollution levels seem lower than they actually were. This misleading information ""may have influenced"" planning decisions in areas such as Nantwich, Congleton, Crewe, Holmes Chapel, and Sandbach. Emails reviewed by the BBC last month indicated that auditors believed the extent and nature of the inaccuracies suggested that human error was ""unlikely"" to be the cause. 

Sean Hannaby, the council's director of planning and sustainable development, reassured the public by stating, ""We would like to assure everyone that we have done everything we can to rectify these failings. There are no immediate health protection measures needed as a result of these errors."" Councillors are responsible for deciding on development proposals. 

All local authorities in the UK are required to monitor air quality and report their findings to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Defra noted that the data provides ""an overview of pollution in areas where people are likely to be present and reveals historical trends that indicate whether policies aimed at improving air quality are effective."" Among the pollutants is nitrogen dioxide from vehicle emissions, which the government has been mandated to reduce. If a council fails to meet national standards, it must declare an Air Quality Management Area and create an action plan.

An internal review by Cheshire East Council auditors in 2016 found discrepancies between the air quality data submitted and the original data from the laboratory that analyzed the readings from the council's monitoring equipment. The report summary stated that the falsified data came from testing stations ""spread over a wide geographical area, suggesting that the manipulation was not intended to favor specific sites."" The council has not provided any comments regarding potential disciplinary measures. A spokesperson for Defra mentioned, ""We are aware of this issue and understand the local authority is now considering its response to the investigation."""
1054,23.0,"Internet searches from the week before the crash were found on the tablet computer used by Andreas Lubitz,
Meanwhile, the second ""black box"" flight recorder from the plane has been recovered.
There were no survivors among the 150 people on board the A320 on 24 March.
The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included ""ways to commit suicide"" and ""cockpit doors and their security provisions"".
Spokesman Ralf Herrenbrueck said: ""He concerned himself on one hand with medical treatment methods, on the other hand with types and ways of going about a suicide.
""In addition, on at least one day he concerned himself with search terms about cockpit doors and their security precautions.''
Prosecutors did not disclose the individual search terms in the browser history but said personal correspondence supported the conclusion Lubitz used the device in the period from 16 to 23 March.
Lubitz, 27, had been deemed fit to fly by his employers at Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.
The first ""black box"", the voice recorder, was recovered almost immediately at the crash site.
Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit.
The second ""black box"" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which should hold technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.
At a press conference, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said there was ""reasonable hope"" the recorder which was being sent to Paris for examination, would provide useful information.
The ""completely blackened"" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said.
He said: ""The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight.""
He told the media 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.
As each DNA set is matched to a victim, families will be notified immediately, he said,
He added 40 mobile phones had been recovered. He said they would be analysed in a laboratory but were ""heavily damaged"".
Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.
Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of ""severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.
``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.
She could not explain why Germanwings had not been informed.
The final minutes
Lubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.
Little more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.

The police didn‚Äôt say exactly what he searched for, but they found out he used the tablet from March 16 to March 23. Lubitz, who was 27, was thought to be okay to fly by his job at Germanwings, which is part of Lufthansa. They found the first ""black box,"" which records voices, right away at the crash site. Investigators think Lubitz crashed Flight 9525 on purpose while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit. 

The second ""black box"" they found is called the flight data recorder (FDR), and it keeps track of things like speed, height, and direction of the plane. A prosecutor named Brice Robin said they hope this second box will help them understand what happened, especially at the end of the flight. They found the box near a ravine, but it was hard to see because it was the same color as the rocks. 

He also mentioned that they found DNA from 150 people at the crash site, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they know who all the victims are yet. They will tell families as soon as they match the DNA to a person. They also found 40 mobile phones, but they were really damaged and will be looked at in a lab.

In the diffuse atomic ISM, we derive the gas-to-dust ratio as the slope of the dust-gas relation and find gas-to-dust ratios of 380+250-130 in the LMC, and 1200+1600-420 in the SMC, not including helium. The atomic-to-molecular transition is located at dust surface densities of 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, corresponding to AV ~ 0.4 and 0.2, respectively. We investigate the range of CO-to-H2 conversion factor to best account for all the molecular gas in the beam of the observations, and find upper limits on XCO to be 6x1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the LMC (Z=0.5Zo) at 15 pc resolution, and 4x 1021 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the SMC (Z=0.2Zo) at 45 pc resolution. In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relation in the dense ISM is lower than in the diffuse ISM by a factor ~2, even after accounting for the effects of CO-dark H2 in the translucent envelopes of molecular clouds. Coagulation of dust grains and the subsequent dust emissivity increase in molecular clouds, and/or accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains, and the subsequent dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) increase in molecular clouds could explain the observations.

In the thin gas areas, we figured out the gas-to-dust ratio, which tells us how much gas there is compared to dust. We found that in the LMC, the ratio is about 380, and in the SMC, it‚Äôs about 1200, not counting helium. The change from atomic gas to molecular gas happens at certain dust amounts, which we measured in both clouds. We also looked at how to best understand the amount of molecular gas we see and found some limits on a special factor in both clouds. In the LMC, the relationship between dust and gas in thick gas areas is different from thin areas, even when we consider some hidden gas. Dust can stick together and get heavier in thick gas areas, or gas metals can stick to dust, which might explain what we see.

We need to do more studies to understand better how dust sticks together, how gas adds to it, and the hidden gas.","The spatial variations of the gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) impose constraints on the chemical evolution and lifecycle of dust within galaxies. This study investigates the relationship between dust and gas at resolutions of 10-50 parsecs in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), utilizing observations from Herschel in the far-infrared (FIR), as well as H I 21 cm, CO, and H-alpha data. In the diffuse atomic interstellar medium (ISM), we calculate the gas-to-dust ratio as the slope of the dust-gas relationship, yielding gas-to-dust ratios of 380+250-130 for the LMC and 1200+1600-420 for the SMC, excluding helium. The transition from atomic to molecular gas occurs at dust surface densities of 0.05 M‚òâ pc^-2 in the LMC and 0.03 M‚òâ pc^-2 in the SMC, which correspond to visual extinctions (AV) of approximately 0.4 and 0.2, respectively. We explore the range of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor to accurately account for all molecular gas within the observational beam, determining upper limits for XCO to be 6x10^20 cm^-2 K^-1 km^-1 s in the LMC (Z=0.5Z‚òâ) at a resolution of 15 parsecs, and 4x10^21 cm^-2 K^-1 km^-1 s in the SMC (Z=0.2Z‚òâ) at a resolution of 45 parsecs. In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relationship in the dense ISM is approximately half that of the diffuse ISM, even after considering the influence of CO-dark H2 in the translucent envelopes of molecular clouds. The observed phenomena may be attributed to the coagulation of dust grains and the resultant increase in dust emissivity within molecular clouds, and/or the accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains, leading to an increase in dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) in these environments. In the SMC, variations in the dust-gas slope due to coagulation or accretion are indistinguishable from the effects of CO-dark H2.

We also looked into the CO-to-H2 conversion factor to accurately account for all the molecular gas in our observations and found upper limits on XCO to be 6x1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the LMC (Z=0.5Zo) at 15 pc resolution, and 4x 1021 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the SMC (Z=0.2Zo) at 45 pc resolution. In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relation in the dense ISM is about half of that in the diffuse ISM, even when we consider CO-dark H2 in the translucent areas of molecular clouds. The increase in dust grain size and dust emissivity in molecular clouds, or the accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains, could explain what we see. In the SMC, changes in the dust-gas slope from coagulation or accretion are mixed up with the effects of CO-dark H2. Within the expected 5--20 times Galactic XCO range, the dust-gas slope might stay the same or drop by several times across different ISM phases. We need more modeling and observations to figure out the relationship between dust grain coagulation, accretion, and CO-dark H2.","Spatial variations in the gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) impose limitations on the chemical evolution and lifecycle of dust within galaxies. This study analyzes the relationship between dust and gas at resolutions of 10-50 pc in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), utilizing data from Herschel far-infrared (FIR), H I 21 cm, CO, and Halpha observations. In the diffuse atomic interstellar medium (ISM), the gas-to-dust ratio is determined as the slope of the dust-gas relationship, yielding values of 380+250-130 for the LMC and 1200+1600-420 for the SMC, excluding helium. The transition from atomic to molecular gas occurs at dust surface densities of 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, which correspond to AV values of approximately 0.4 and 0.2, respectively. The study explores the range of CO-to-H2 conversion factors to accurately represent all molecular gas within the observational beam, establishing upper limits for XCO at 6x10^20 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the LMC (Z=0.5Zo) at 15 pc resolution, and 4x10^21 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the SMC (Z=0.2Zo) at 45 pc resolution. In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relationship in the dense ISM is approximately half that of the diffuse ISM, even after considering the influence of CO-dark H2 in the translucent envelopes of molecular clouds. The observed phenomena may be attributed to the coagulation of dust grains and the resulting increase in dust emissivity within molecular clouds, or the accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust grains, leading to an increase in dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) in these regions. In the SMC, variations in the dust-gas slope due to coagulation or accretion are indistinguishable from the effects of CO-dark H2. Within the anticipated range of 5-20 times the Galactic XCO, the dust-gas slope may remain constant or decrease significantly across different ISM phases. Additional modeling and observational efforts are necessary to resolve the ambiguity between dust grain coagulation, accretion, and CO-dark H2.","The differences in the gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) across space help us understand how dust evolves chemically and its lifecycle in galaxies.

The transition from atomic to molecular gas occurs at dust surface densities of 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, which correspond to visual extinctions (AV) of about 0.4 and 0.2, respectively.

In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relationship in the dense ISM is about half that of the diffuse ISM, even when considering the influence of CO-dark H2 in the translucent areas surrounding molecular clouds.

Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  Thanks for taking the question seriously!

I've always found that idea sort of baffling for hygienic reasons, but then I started to wonder if my confusion/repulsion had any basis in fact.

1460,74.0,"They also provide the first direct evidence that there may be as much water trapped in those rocks as there is in all the oceans.
The diamond, from central-west Brazil, contains minerals that formed as deep as 600km down and that have significant amounts of water trapped within them.
Researchers have published their findings in the journal Nature.
The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets.
Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.
A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.
They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.
While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.
While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.
Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: ""Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.""
The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.
Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: ""The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.
""It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.""
Describing his diamond sample, he said: ""It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.""
Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.
He said: ""I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.
""This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.""
A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.
Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.
Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.
Given the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term ""blue planet"" seems even more appropriate for Earth.",0,"Scientists found out that there might be a lot of water stuck in rocks, maybe even as much as all the oceans! They studied a diamond from Brazil that has minerals formed really deep down, about 600 kilometers below the surface, and these minerals have a lot of water in them. They shared their discoveries in a science magazine called Nature.

This study suggests that many rocky planets might have water stored deep inside them. Diamonds come from deep volcanic eruptions and can tell us a lot about what‚Äôs below the Earth. A team led by Professor Graham Pearson from Canada looked at a diamond that is 100 million years old from Brazil. They found a special mineral called ringwoodite in it, which only forms really deep down, between 410 and 660 kilometers below the surface. This shows that some diamonds come from super deep places.

Even though ringwoodite has been found in space rocks before, this is the first time it was found in a diamond from Earth. The cool part is that this mineral has about 1% water in it. That might not sound like much, but since ringwoodite is everywhere in the deep Earth, it means there‚Äôs a lot of water down there!

Dr. Sally Gibson from Cambridge University, who didn‚Äôt work on this study, said that finding so much water is really important for understanding where the water on Earth comes from. This is the first real proof that planets can hold water deep inside them, and it helps solve a big question about whether the deep Earth is dry or wet.

Professor Pearson told BBC News that diamonds are special because they keep pieces of the deep Earth safe. He said it‚Äôs amazing to think that the pressure inside the diamond is super high, like 20,000 times more than what we feel on the surface. He described the diamond as looking like it‚Äôs been through a lot, which it has!

Professor Joseph Smyth from Colorado has studied ringwoodite for a long time. He thinks it‚Äôs amazing because it means the Earth might hold way more water than all the oceans combined. This shows that hydrogen is really important for the Earth and didn‚Äôt just come from comets later on. 

This discovery suggests that water-rich planets like Earth might be common in our galaxy. A big question now is how much water gets recycled deep inside Earth because of plate tectonics, and how much water might be trapped in other rocky planets. Ringwoodite might also form deep inside Mars, where it touches the metal core.

In Professor Smyth's lab, they made some ringwoodite","The research provides the inaugural direct evidence suggesting that the volume of water contained within certain rocks may equal that of all the oceans combined. The diamond, sourced from central-west Brazil, encompasses minerals that originated at depths of up to 600 kilometers, which possess substantial quantities of water encapsulated within them. The findings have been disseminated in the journal Nature. This study posits that water may be sequestered deep within the interiors of numerous rocky planets.

Diamonds, which are brought to the Earth's surface through violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks known as kimberlites, offer a compelling glimpse into the Earth's deep structure. A research team, led by Professor Graham Pearson from the University of Alberta, Canada, examined a diamond from a kimberlite that is approximately 100 million years old, located in Juina, Brazil, as part of a broader research initiative. They identified the presence of a mineral called ringwoodite, which is believed to form at depths ranging from 410 to 660 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface, thereby indicating the significant depths from which some diamonds originate.

While ringwoodite has been previously identified in meteorites, this marks the first instance of terrestrial ringwoodite being observed. More remarkably, the researchers discovered that this mineral contains approximately 1% water. Although this percentage may seem minimal, the predominance of ringwoodite within this vast segment of the deep Earth suggests a substantial total volume of deep water. Dr. Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, remarked, ""The discovery of water in such considerable concentrations represents a profoundly significant advancement in our comprehension of the ultimate origin of water currently present on the Earth's surface.""

This observation constitutes the first physical evidence that water can be retained in the deep interiors of planets, thereby resolving a 25-year-old debate regarding whether the deep Earth is arid, moist, or intermittently wet. In discussing his findings, Professor Pearson stated to BBC News, ""This discovery underscores the unique significance of natural diamonds in capturing and preserving fragments of the deep Earth. It is astonishing to consider that, as one holds this sample, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres."" He further described his diamond sample as appearing as though it has endured extreme conditions, which it indeed has.

Professor Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has dedicated many years to the study of ringwoodite and analogous minerals synthesized in his laboratory. He expressed, ""I find it remarkable! It suggests that the Earth's interior may","üåäüíé Exciting news from the world of geology! Researchers have discovered that a diamond from Brazil contains minerals formed deep within the Earth, possibly holding as much water as all the oceans combined! üåçüíß This groundbreaking study, published in Nature, suggests that many rocky planets might store water deep inside. 

The diamond, found in a 100-million-year-old volcanic rock, contains ringwoodite, a mineral that forms between 410-660 km below the surface and holds about 1% water. While that may seem small, it adds up to a massive amount of water in the deep Earth! 

Prof. Graham Pearson and his team have provided the first physical evidence that water can be stored deep within planets, solving a long-standing debate about the Earth's interior. üååüí¶ 

Prof. Joseph Smyth highlights the significance of this discovery, suggesting that the Earth's interior may hold several times the ocean's water and that hydrogen plays a crucial role in Earth's processes. 

This raises questions about how plate tectonics recycle water and hints that water-rich planets like Earth could be common in our galaxy! üåå‚ú® With these findings, the term ""blue planet"" feels even more fitting for Earth! #Geology #WaterInTheEarth #DiamondDiscovery #BluePlanet","OMG, so they found some crazy evidence that there might be as much water trapped in rocks as there is in all the oceans! üåäüíé This diamond from central-west Brazil has minerals that formed like 600km deep and they got a lot of water in them. Researchers just published this in Nature. 

The study hints that water could be stored really deep in rocky planets. Diamonds come up to the surface during these intense volcanic eruptions called kimberlites, and they give us a peek into the deep Earth. A team led by Prof Graham Pearson from the University of Alberta looked at a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite in Juina, Brazil, as part of a bigger project. 

They found this mineral called ringwoodite, which is only supposed to form between 410km and 660km below the surface, showing how deep some diamonds really are. While ringwoodite has been found in meteorites before, this is the first time they‚Äôve seen it on Earth. And get this, it has about 1% water in it! üíß 

That might not sound like a lot, but since ringwoodite is everywhere down there, it adds up to a ton of deep water. Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who wasn‚Äôt part of the study, said finding water in such high amounts is a big deal for understanding where Earth‚Äôs surface water comes from. 

This is the first real proof that water can be stored deep inside planets, solving a 25-year debate about whether the deep Earth is dry or wet. Prof Pearson told BBC News that diamonds are super valuable for trapping pieces of the deep Earth. He said, ""It's wild to think that this sample has 20,000 atmospheres of pressure at the diamond's surface."" 

He described his diamond as looking like it‚Äôs been through a lot, which it totally has! Prof Joseph Smyth from the University of Colorado has been studying ringwoodite for years and said it‚Äôs amazing! He thinks it means the Earth‚Äôs interior could hold way more water than the oceans, and that hydrogen is a key part of Earth, not just something added later by comets. 

This discovery suggests that hydrogen might control what happens inside the Earth just like it does on the surface, and that water-rich planets like Earth could be common in our galaxy. A big question now is how much plate tectonics on Earth recycles water deep down and how much water might be trapped in other rocky planets. 

Ringwoodite is","The research provides initial direct evidence indicating that the volume of water contained within certain rocks may equal that of all the oceans combined. A diamond sourced from central-west Brazil contains minerals formed at depths of up to 600 kilometers, which hold significant quantities of water. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. This study implies that water could be stored deep within the interiors of various rocky planets. Diamonds, which are brought to the Earth's surface through explosive eruptions of deep volcanic rocks known as kimberlites, offer valuable insights into the deep Earth.

A research team led by Professor Graham Pearson from the University of Alberta, Canada, examined a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite located in Juina, Brazil, as part of a broader project. They discovered that the diamond contained ringwoodite, a mineral believed to form at depths between 410 kilometers and 660 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface, indicating the significant depth from which some diamonds originate. Although ringwoodite has been previously identified in meteorites, this marks the first observation of terrestrial ringwoodite. Remarkably, the mineral was found to contain approximately 1% water. While this percentage may seem minimal, the extensive presence of ringwoodite in the deep Earth suggests a substantial total volume of deep water.

Dr. Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not part of the study, remarked that the discovery of water in such high concentrations is a major advancement in understanding the ultimate source of water currently found on Earth's surface. This observation serves as the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets, resolving a 25-year debate regarding the moisture levels in the deep Earth.

In discussing the findings, Professor Pearson stated to BBC News that the discovery underscores the unique ability of natural diamonds to capture and preserve fragments of the deep Earth. He noted the extreme pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion, which is 20,000 atmospheres. Describing the diamond sample, he remarked that it appears to have undergone extreme conditions, which it indeed has.

Professor Joseph Smyth from the University of Colorado, who has extensively studied ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesized in his lab, expressed his astonishment at the findings. He suggested that the interior of the Earth may store multiple times the amount of water found in the oceans, indicating that hydrogen is a fundamental component of the Earth rather than a later addition from comets. This discovery suggests that hydrogen may influence the interior processes of the Earth similarly to how it affects surface processes, implying that water","Recent research has provided the first solid evidence suggesting that the amount of water trapped in certain rocks could rival that found in all the oceans combined.

3773,7267.0,"This paper examines the relationship between energy complexity and other Boolean function measures. Energy complexity measures the amount of energy required to change the state of a physical system from its ground state to a higher energy state. Boolean functions are mathematical operations which take binary inputs and produce binary outputs. They are commonly used in computer science, cryptography, and electrical engineering. Previous research has shown that energy complexity is a useful measure for analyzing the behavior of physical systems in the presence of noise, but its relationship with other Boolean function measures is not well understood.

We start by reviewing the definitions and properties of energy complexity and other Boolean function measures, such as sensitivity, block sensitivity, and decision tree complexity. We then present a series of theoretical and empirical results that explore the relationships between these measures. We show that there are surprising connections between energy complexity and the other measures, and that these connections have implications for practical applications.

One of our main theoretical results shows that energy complexity is related to the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions, which are a powerful tool for analyzing their properties. Specifically, we prove that the energy complexity of a Boolean function is upper-bounded by the sum of the absolute values of its Fourier coefficients. We also show that this upper bound is tight for a large class of functions, and that it implies interesting trade-offs between energy complexity and other measures such as sensitivity.

We provide empirical evidence for our theoretical results by analyzing the performance of algorithms that minimize energy complexity and other Boolean function measures for specific problems, such as Boolean matrix multiplication and graph coloring. Our experiments show that energy complexity is often a good predictor of the running time and accuracy of these algorithms, and that it can lead to significant improvements over other measures.

In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of energy complexity as a measure of Boolean function behavior, and provide new insights into its relationships with other measures.

Energy complexity is about how much energy you need to change something from a low energy state to a higher one.

Then, we share some cool findings that show how these measures are connected. We found out that energy complexity has some surprising links to the other measures, and this can help in real-life situations.

One big finding we have is that energy complexity is connected to something called Fourier spectra of Boolean functions, which helps us look at their properties. We proved that the energy complexity of a Boolean function can‚Äôt be more than the total of the absolute values of its Fourier coefficients. We also found that this limit works well for many functions and shows interesting trade-offs between energy complexity and other measures like sensitivity.

We also did some tests to back up our findings by looking at how well algorithms that try to reduce energy complexity and other Boolean function measures work for specific problems, like multiplying Boolean matrices and coloring graphs. Our tests showed that energy complexity often helps predict how fast and accurate these algorithms will be, and it can make them work a lot better than using other measures.

In the end, our results show that energy complexity is really important for understanding how Boolean functions behave, and they give us new ideas about how it connects with other measures. We think these ideas will help in creating and analyzing new algorithms and physical systems in the future.","This paper investigates the correlation between energy complexity and various measures of Boolean functions.

3901,7375.0,"Understanding the interplay between reionization and dwarf galaxy formation is a critical aspect of modern cosmology, as it provides a unique window into the early universe. In this paper, we investigate how the imprint of reionization affects the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies. Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the relationship between the onset of reionization and the formation of the first generation of dwarf galaxies. Our findings suggest that the timing of reionization has a significant impact on the star formation histories of these galaxies, as it determines their ability to efficiently cool gas and form stars.

We find that dwarf galaxies that form before reionization are able to retain their gas and efficiently form stars over prolonged periods of time, leading to a more continuous star formation history. In contrast, dwarf galaxies that form after reionization experience significant gas loss and are unable to form stars as efficiently, leading to a truncated star formation history. Our simulations also reveal that the mass of the dwarf galaxy plays a crucial role in determining its response to reionization, with lower mass galaxies being more susceptible to gas loss.

We explore the observational consequences of our findings by comparing the predicted star formation histories of our simulated galaxies to observations. We find that our models successfully reproduce the observed scatter in the star formation rate-stellar mass relation of dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, our simulations predict a correlation between the slope of the star formation rate-stellar mass relation and the timing of reionization.

Overall, our study sheds light on the complex interplay between reionization and dwarf galaxy formation and highlights the importance of considering these effects in models of galaxy formation and evolution.",1,"Understanding how reionization and dwarf galaxies work together is super important for learning about the early universe. In this paper, we look at how reionization affects how stars are made in dwarf galaxies. We used special computer simulations to see how the start of reionization connects to the first dwarf galaxies.

We found out that when dwarf galaxies form before reionization, they can keep their gas and make stars for a long time, which means they have a steady star-making history. But if dwarf galaxies form after reionization, they lose a lot of gas and can‚Äôt make stars as well, so their star-making history is shorter. We also learned that the size of the dwarf galaxy matters a lot; smaller galaxies lose gas more easily.

We checked our findings by comparing the star-making histories from our simulations to what we see in real life. Our models matched well with the different star-making rates and sizes of dwarf galaxies we observe. Plus, our simulations showed a link between how steep the star-making rate is and when reionization happened.

In the end, our study helps us understand how reionization and dwarf galaxy formation work together and shows why it‚Äôs important to think about these things when studying how galaxies form and change over time.","The examination of the relationship between reionization and the formation of dwarf galaxies constitutes a vital component of contemporary cosmology, as it offers a distinctive perspective on the early universe.

Our results indicate that the timing of reionization significantly affects the star formation histories of these galaxies, as it influences their capacity to effectively cool gas and generate stars.

Our findings reveal that dwarf galaxies formed prior to reionization are capable of retaining their gas and sustaining efficient star formation over extended periods, resulting in a more continuous star formation history. Conversely, dwarf galaxies that arise subsequent to reionization encounter considerable gas loss and exhibit diminished efficiency in star formation, culminating in a truncated star formation history. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that the mass of the dwarf galaxy is a critical factor in determining its response to reionization, with lower mass galaxies being more vulnerable to gas loss.

We further investigate the observational implications of our results by juxtaposing the predicted star formation histories of our simulated galaxies with empirical observations.

3417,8109.0,"The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a dwarf galaxy located just outside our own Milky Way and is of great interest to astronomers due to its unique properties and proximity. In this study, we present the results of the Spitzer survey conducted to investigate the far-infrared (FIR) emission and cold gas content of the SMC.

Our analysis of the FIR emission reveals that the SMC has a significant amount of dust, which is necessary for the formation of stars. We also find that the dust-to-gas ratio in the SMC is lower compared to the Milky Way, which suggests that the star formation activity in the SMC is regulated by different physical processes.

In addition, we detect cold molecular gas in the SMC using carbon monoxide (CO) as a tracer. The CO measurements reveal that the SMC has a total gas mass of ~2 x 10^8 solar masses, which is lower compared to the Milky Way. We also find that the CO emission in the SMC is best explained by a combination of diffuse and dense molecular clouds, indicating a complex and highly structured interstellar medium.

Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the cold gas and the star formation activity in the SMC. We find a clear correlation between the molecular gas and the recent star formation activity, suggesting that the cold gas is the fuel for the star-forming regions in the SMC. However, the molecular gas distribution in the SMC is not uniform and shows a clumpy structure, which may explain the patchy distribution of star-forming regions.

In this research, we talk about what we found out from a Spitzer survey that looked at the far-infrared light and cold gas in the SMC.

We discovered that the SMC has a lot of dust, which is super important for making stars. But, the amount of dust compared to gas in the SMC is less than in the Milky Way. This means that the way stars are made in the SMC is different from how they are made in our galaxy.

We also found cold gas in the SMC by using something called carbon monoxide (CO) to help us see it. The CO showed us that the SMC has about 200 million times the mass of our Sun in gas, which is less than what the Milky Way has. The CO signals tell us that the gas in the SMC is made up of both spread-out and thick clouds, which means the space between stars is really complicated.

We also looked at how the cold gas is connected to making new stars in the SMC. We saw that there is a clear link between the cold gas and where new stars are forming, which means the cold gas helps create new stars. But the way the gas is spread out in the SMC is not even; it‚Äôs all clumpy, which might explain why new stars are forming in patches.

The CO measurements indicate that the total gas mass of the SMC is approximately 2 x 10^8 solar masses, which is comparatively lower than that of the Milky Way.

In this research, we share findings from the Spitzer survey aimed at examining the far-infrared (FIR) emission and the cold gas present in the SMC.

Our investigation into the FIR emission indicates that the SMC contains a considerable amount of dust, which is essential for star formation. We also observe that the dust-to-gas ratio in the SMC is lower than that of the Milky Way, implying that different physical processes govern star formation in the SMC.

Additionally, we identify cold molecular gas in the SMC by using carbon monoxide (CO) as a tracer. The CO data suggest that the total gas mass in the SMC is approximately 2 x 10^8 solar masses, which is less than that of the Milky Way. Our findings indicate that the CO emission in the SMC can be best understood through a mix of diffuse and dense molecular clouds, pointing to a complex and intricately structured interstellar medium.

Moreover, we explore the connection between cold gas and star formation activity in the SMC. We discover a clear link between molecular gas and recent star formation, indicating that the cold gas serves as the fuel for star-forming regions in the SMC. However, the distribution of molecular gas is uneven and exhibits a clumpy pattern, which may account for the irregular distribution of star-forming areas.

In summary, our Spitzer survey of the SMC has shed light on the FIR emission and cold gas content of this fascinating dwarf galaxy. Our findings underscore the necessity of considering the variations in physical and chemical processes when examining star formation in galaxies outside the Milky Way."

1. **Diplomatic Disputes**: Tensions or disagreements between nations may prompt a recall to signal discontent.
2. **Security Concerns**: If a diplomat's safety is at risk due to political instability or conflict, a recall may occur.
3. **Policy Changes**: A shift in foreign policy or strategy may necessitate the recall of diplomats to reassess relations.
4. **Protests or Hostile Actions**: In response to protests or actions perceived as hostile, countries may recall diplomats to express condemnation.
5. **Negotiation Leverage**: A recall can be used as a tactic to gain leverage in negotiations or to pressure the other country.
6. **Symbolic Gesture**: A recall may serve as a symbolic act to demonstrate solidarity with allies or to express disapproval of another country's actions.

These actions are typically aimed at managing international relations and signaling a country's stance on various issues.","Countries often recall diplomats for several political reasons. One common reason is to express disapproval or protest against another nation's actions, such as human rights violations or aggressive policies. Diplomatic recalls can also occur during times of heightened tensions or conflicts, signaling a serious diplomatic rift.

However, he said more work was needed and there was no guarantee of success.
A cessation of hostilities has reduced fighting in Syria's five-year civil war but has unravelled in recent days.
About 250 people have reportedly been killed in Aleppo in the past nine days.
On Monday, fresh government air strikes and artillery attacks on rebel-held districts and suburbs of Aleppo left at least three dead, according to activists.
Mr Kerry, speaking alongside UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura after a morning of talks in Geneva, said the conflict was ""in many ways out of control and deeply disturbing"".
He said the nine-week-old cessation of hostilities had had ""a profoundly positive effect"" and saved many lives, but in recent weeks it had been ""put to the test"".
Mr Kerry said the goal was to reinforce a broad truce that could withstand further tests. He also promised more ceasefire monitors to track violations ""24 hours a day, seven days a week"".
""We're trying to press this as fast as possible but I don't want to make any promises that can't be kept,"" he said.
The US secretary of state said a recent air strike on a hospital in Aleppo, which he blamed on the Syrian government, was ""unconscionable"" but he added that both sides, the opposition and the regime, had contributed to ""this chaos"".
Before leaving Geneva, Mr Kerry spoke by telephone to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Both men reiterated calls for all sides to observe the cessation of hostilities, the Russian foreign ministry said.
Mr de Mistura is due to travel to Russia on Tuesday.
Mr Kerry's trip to Geneva was hastily arranged after Mr de Mistura appealed to the US and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's five-year conflict, to rescue the cessation of hostilities they brokered in February.
At the start of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr Kerry said he would press rebel groups in Aleppo to separate themselves from the powerful jihadist group, al-Nusra Front.
""This is what we're discussing, among other things. There are a number of different ways to approach it,"" Mr Kerry told reporters.
""We're getting closer to a place of understanding. But we have some work to do.""
The Syrian government and Russia have said the Aleppo air strikes are targeting only al-Nusra, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is excluded from the cessation of hostilities along with the rival Islamic State group.
However, the opposition and the US have dismissed the claim, and accused the government of targeting civilians and rebels abiding by the cessation of hostilities.
""What is happening in Aleppo is an outrage. It's a violation of all humanitarian laws. It's a crime,"" Mr Jubeir said, adding that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be held accountable and would be removed from power either through a political process or by force.
The fighting in Aleppo has also seen dozens of civilians killed in rebel artillery attacks on government-held areas.
After at least 50 people were killed in a reported government air strike on a hospital last Wednesday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that Aleppo was being ""pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster"".
Large parts of the city have been destroyed and its infrastructure has been severely damaged, leaving civilians without water and electricity for months.
The talks in Geneva come a day after the Syrian military extended a ""regime of calm"" around the capital, Damascus, for another 24 hours.
The unilateral truce also covers the northern countryside of the coastal province of Latakia,
More than three dozen rebel factions said on Saturday that they would not respect the truce, unless the government agreed to extend it over the whole country.",0,"After talking with some important people from the UN and Arab countries in Geneva, he said they made some progress on a plan to stop the fighting in Aleppo, which is the second biggest city in Syria. But he also said they still have a lot of work to do and there‚Äôs no promise it will work. 

There was a break in fighting that helped reduce violence in Syria's civil war, which has been going on for five years, but things have gotten worse again recently. In the last nine days, about 250 people have died in Aleppo. On Monday, new air strikes and attacks from the government hit areas where rebels live, and at least three people died, according to some activists.

Mr. Kerry, who was talking with a UN special envoy named Staffan de Mistura after their meetings in Geneva, said the fighting is ""out of control and really upsetting."" He mentioned that the break in fighting had saved many lives but was being tested lately. Mr. Kerry wants to make a strong truce that can hold up against more challenges and said they would have more people watching to make sure everyone follows the rules all the time.

He said they are trying to move quickly but didn‚Äôt want to make promises they can‚Äôt keep. Mr. Kerry also said a recent air strike on a hospital in Aleppo, which he said was done by the Syrian government, was really bad, but he noted that both sides have made things worse.

Before leaving Geneva, Mr. Kerry talked on the phone with a Russian leader named Sergei Lavrov, and they both said everyone should stick to the break in fighting. Mr. de Mistura is going to Russia on Tuesday.

Mr. Kerry went to Geneva quickly after Mr. de Mistura asked the US and Russia, who support different sides in the conflict, to help save the break in fighting they agreed on in February. When he met with a Saudi leader on Monday, Mr. Kerry said he would ask the rebel groups in Aleppo to separate from a strong group called al-Nusra Front.

He told reporters they are discussing different ways to handle this and that they are getting closer to understanding each other, but there‚Äôs still work to do. The Syrian government and Russia say their air strikes are only hitting al-Nusra, which is linked to al-Qaeda and not included in the break in fighting, along with the Islamic State group. But the rebels and the US say that‚Äôs not true and accuse the government of hitting civilians and rebels who are following the rules.

Mr. J","Following discussions with United Nations and Arab diplomats in Geneva, he indicated that advancements had been achieved regarding a strategy aimed at diminishing violence in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. Nevertheless, he emphasized that additional efforts were required and that success could not be assured. 

A cessation of hostilities had previously mitigated combat in Syria's protracted civil war, yet it has deteriorated in recent days. Reports indicate that approximately 250 individuals have lost their lives in Aleppo over the past nine days. On Monday, renewed government airstrikes and artillery bombardments targeting rebel-controlled areas and suburbs of Aleppo resulted in at least three fatalities, as reported by activists.

Mr. Kerry, addressing the media alongside UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura after a morning of discussions in Geneva, characterized the conflict as ""in many ways out of control and deeply disturbing."" He acknowledged that the nine-week-old cessation of hostilities had a ""profoundly positive effect"" and had preserved numerous lives, but noted that it had recently been ""put to the test.""

Mr. Kerry articulated the objective of reinforcing a comprehensive truce capable of enduring further challenges. He also committed to deploying additional ceasefire monitors to oversee violations ""24 hours a day, seven days a week."" ""We are endeavoring to expedite this process, but I do not wish to make any commitments that cannot be fulfilled,"" he stated.

Mr. Kerry's visit to Geneva was arranged swiftly following Mr. de Mistura's appeal to the United States and Russia, which support opposing factions in Syria's five-year conflict, to salvage the cessation of hostilities they had brokered in February.

At the commencement of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr. Kerry stated his intention to urge rebel groups in Aleppo to dissociate themselves from the influential jihadist organization, al-Nusra Front. ""This is among the topics we are discussing, along with various other approaches","üö® Update from Geneva! After discussions with UN and Arab diplomats, progress is being made on a plan to reduce violence in Aleppo, but there's still a long way to go and no guarantees.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, alongside UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, expressed concern over the situation, calling it ""deeply disturbing."" While the truce has saved many lives, it‚Äôs facing serious challenges. Kerry emphasized the need for more ceasefire monitors to ensure compliance around the clock. 

He condemned a recent airstrike on a hospital in Aleppo as ""unconscionable,"" holding both the Syrian government and opposition accountable for the chaos. Kerry is also urging rebel groups to distance themselves from the al-Nusra Front to help stabilize the situation. 

The humanitarian crisis in Aleppo is dire, with civilians suffering from lack of basic necessities. The International Committee of the Red Cross warns the city is on the brink of disaster.

As Stormont's parties have paused talks to form an executive until after Easter, Sinn F√©in is pushing for an Irish Language Act. While Mrs. Foster previously stated the DUP would never support such an act, she‚Äôs now open to meeting with those who genuinely appreciate the language. 

Mr. √ì Muilleoir believes that the Irish language community is diverse and united in their belief that Irish is a shared treasure. He hopes Mrs. Foster will recognize its importance, even for unionists still on their journey of understanding. 

Pobal, an Irish language group, is ready to meet with Mrs. Foster and has reached out to arrange a discussion. Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going! üáÆüá™üí¨ #IrishLanguage #Dialogue #Understanding","So, Mrs. Foster was saying on Wed that she wants to get a better grip on the folks who love the Irish language.

Mr. √ì Muilleoir is hoping the meeting happens soon, calling it a ""positive move."" He thinks anything that sparks dialogue and understanding is a good thing. 

Right now, Stormont's parties have ""paused"" their talks to form an executive until after Easter, and it's been almost six weeks since the assembly election with no deal yet. One of Sinn F√©in's big goals in these talks is to make sure an Irish Language Act gets passed. Back in Feb, Arlene Foster said the DUP would never agree to that, but now she‚Äôs open to meeting with ""people who genuinely love the Irish language and don‚Äôt wanna use it as a political tool.""

Mr. √ì Muilleoir hopes she‚Äôll really listen to the Irish speakers since they‚Äôre ""united and firm on the need for an Irish Language Act."" He thinks Arlene will see that the Irish language community is diverse, with people from all political backgrounds. He believes they all agree that Irish is a shared treasure and a gift they want to share, even with unionists who might not fully get how important the language is yet.

He also mentioned it‚Äôs ""too early"" to say where the DUP stands on the Irish Language Act, but he thinks the meeting will be good for both her and the Irish language community. The Irish language group Pobal said they‚Äôd ""gladly accept"" Mrs. Foster's invite to meet with Irish speakers and have even written to her to set up a meeting.","On Wednesday, Mrs. Foster expressed her desire to gain a deeper understanding of individuals who appreciate the language.

Anything that fosters dialogue, encourages conversations, and promotes greater understanding is beneficial."" 

Currently, Stormont's parties have ""paused"" negotiations to establish an executive until after Easter, with no agreement reached nearly six weeks post-assembly election. A primary focus for Sinn F√©in in these discussions is securing a commitment to implement an Irish Language Act. In February, Arlene Foster stated that the DUP would never consent to such an act; however, she has since indicated her willingness to meet with ""individuals who genuinely cherish the Irish language and do not wish to politicize it.""

Mr. √ì Muilleoir expressed hope that Mrs. Foster would attentively consider the perspectives of Irish speakers, who are ""united and firm on the necessity of an Irish Language Act."" He noted, ""I believe Arlene will discover that the Irish language community is diverse, encompassing individuals with various political beliefs and none."" He emphasized that they are united in the conviction that the Irish language is a shared asset of the community, a gift that they wish to share with everyone, including unionists who have yet to fully appreciate the significance of the Irish language.

He remarked that it is ""premature"" to assess the DUP's position regarding an Irish Language Act, but he believes the meeting will be advantageous for both Mrs. Foster and the Irish language community. The Irish language organization Pobal stated that it would ""gladly accept"" Mrs. Foster's invitation to meet with Irish speakers and has reached out to her to arrange a meeting.","On Wednesday, Mrs. Foster expressed her desire to gain a deeper understanding of those who cherish the Irish language.

3466,4909.0,"The Kondo-Heisenberg model is a well-known theoretical paradigm in condensed matter physics used to describe the interplay between localized spins and itinerant electrons. Its investigation has led to significant advances in our understanding of strongly correlated materials. One such material is CeCoIn$_{5}$, a heavy-fermion superconductor with a complex electronic structure, host to competing phases of magnetism and superconductivity. In this study, we investigate the Fermionology of the Kondo-Heisenberg model and its manifestation in CeCoIn$_{5}$. We employ a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques, including mean-field theory and neutron scattering, to probe the magnetic and electronic interactions in this system.

Our results reveal two distinct regimes of behavior. At low temperatures, strong magnetic fluctuations induce a Kondo screening of the local moments by the itinerant electrons, leading to a hybridization gap in the electronic density of states. At higher temperatures, the magnetic interactions become weaker, and the system undergoes a transition to a fluctuating paramagnet regime with a reduced Kondo screening.

These findings provide important insights into fundamental concepts of correlated electron physics, including the nature of magnetic order, the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, and the role of quantum critical fluctuations. Moreover, they shed new light on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in heavy-fermion materials, with implications for the development of new, high-transition-temperature superconductors.",1,"The Kondo-Heisenberg model is a famous idea in physics that helps scientists understand how certain tiny particles called spins and moving electrons work together.

In this research, we look at how the Kondo-Heisenberg model works in CeCoIn$_{5}$. We use different methods, like mean-field theory and neutron scattering, to explore how the magnetic and electronic parts interact in this material.

Our results show two different behaviors. When it‚Äôs really cold, strong magnetic changes cause the moving electrons to hide the local spins, which creates a gap in the electronic density of states. When it gets warmer, the magnetic interactions get weaker, and the material changes to a state where the magnetism is more random and the Kondo hiding is less strong.

These discoveries help us understand important ideas about how electrons interact, like how magnetism works, how magnetism and superconductivity affect each other, and how tiny quantum changes play a role.

It's all about balancing cooling power, performance, and how much power it uses. We mix thermodynamics with quantum mechanics to really dig into it. We made a numerical model using a driven two-level system and the quantum master equation to look at how the fridge works. Then, we figured out the trade-offs between those key factors and found the best performance points for both weak and strong coupling situations. Our findings reveal the physical stuff behind the optimization, like how heat transfer and non-equilibrium effects compete. Plus, we show that these optimal points can actually be reached in current experiments by looking at some recent studies. Overall, our research gives a solid guide for making a three-level quantum fridge work better, which is super important for things like cooling quantum devices and solid-state physics experiments.","This document introduces a comprehensive trade-off optimization strategy for a three-level quantum refrigerator.

These include:

1. **Hawking Radiation**: This theory suggests that black holes emit radiation, leading to the gradual loss of mass and potentially allowing information to escape over time.

2. **Black Hole Complementarity**: This idea posits that information is preserved both inside the black hole and outside, but cannot be observed simultaneously, thus maintaining consistency in quantum mechanics.

3. **Firewall Hypothesis**: This controversial theory proposes that an energetic ""firewall"" exists at the event horizon, which would destroy incoming information, challenging traditional views of black hole behavior.

4. **Quantum Entanglement**: Some researchers suggest that entangled particles could provide a mechanism for information to be preserved and transmitted, even in the presence of a black hole.

5. **Holographic Principle**: This principle implies that all information contained within a volume of space can be represented as a theory on the boundary of that space, suggesting that black hole information is encoded on its surface.

6. **ER=EPR Conjecture**: This hypothesis connects entangled particles (EPR pairs) with wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges), proposing that information may be transmitted through these connections.

These theories represent ongoing efforts to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics with the nature of black holes.",What are some of the key theories or concepts being suggested to address the information paradox associated with black holes?

Let's dive into the potential implications! üìàüí° #Investing #Economy #Taxation,"Hey! So, taxing unrealized capital gains could have a few impacts on investors and the economy, right? 

1. **Investor Behavior**: Investors might change how they invest, maybe being less willing to take risks or hold onto assets for long-term growth since they‚Äôd be taxed on gains they haven‚Äôt actually realized yet.

2. **Market Volatility**: It could lead to more volatility in the markets, as people might sell off assets to avoid taxes, which could mess with prices.

3. **Cash Flow Issues**: Some investors might face cash flow problems if they have to pay taxes on gains without actually selling anything, which could be tough for those who don‚Äôt have liquid assets.

4. **Economic Growth**: It might slow down economic growth since people could be less inclined to invest in new ventures or startups if they know they‚Äôll be taxed on potential gains.

5. **Equity Concerns**: There could be fairness issues too, as it might hit certain groups harder, like those who rely on investments for income.

3177,19717.0,"The northern nucleus of Mrk273, a nearby merging galaxy system, has been thoroughly examined in this study to determine the physical and chemical properties of the disk and its outflow of molecular gas. Through extensive observations and analyses, it has been determined that the disk of molecular gas has a radius of approximately 325 parsecs and a mass of approximately 4.6 x 10^8 solar masses. The outflow has a projected velocity of approximately 80 km/s and a mass outflow rate of approximately 4.5 solar masses per year.

Through the use of multi-transition observations of carbon monoxide (CO) and methanol (CH3OH), the gas properties of the disk were studied. It was found that the gas is primarily dense, with an average density of 10^4 to 10^5 cm^-3. In addition to this, clear evidence of outflowing gas was detected, which indicates active star formation in the nucleus.

Additionally, chemical analysis was performed to determine the composition of the gas. Based on observations of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and formaldehyde, it was found that the molecular gas in the nucleus is highly enriched in nitrogen, sulfur, and heavy elements. These observations suggest that the molecular gas likely originated from an external source before falling into the nucleus.

Finally, the kinematic properties of the outflowing gas were studied. The results showed that the outflow is likely driven by a combination of stellar winds and supernovae rather than active galactic nuclei. This conclusion was based on the relatively low velocity and mass outflow rate of the gas.

In summary, our study presents a detailed analysis of the molecular gas in the northern nucleus of Mrk273, revealing fascinating insights into its physical and chemical properties and its outflow. Our findings provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of galaxies and the role of molecular gas in these processes.",1,"In this study, we looked closely at the northern part of Mrk273, which is a nearby galaxy that is merging with another one. We wanted to find out more about the gas in the galaxy and how it moves. We found out that the gas disk is about 325 parsecs wide and weighs around 4.6 x 10^8 times as much as our Sun. The gas is moving away from the galaxy at about 80 kilometers per second and is losing about 4.5 solar masses of gas every year.

To learn more about the gas, we used special tools to look at different types of gas like carbon monoxide (CO) and methanol (CH3OH). We discovered that the gas is really dense, with lots of particles packed into a small space. We also saw that some gas is flowing out, which means new stars are being made in that part of the galaxy.

We also checked what the gas is made of. By looking at gases like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and formaldehyde, we found that the gas has a lot of nitrogen, sulfur, and heavy elements. This suggests that the gas probably came from somewhere else before it got to the galaxy.

Lastly, we studied how the gas is moving. We think that the outflow is caused by winds from stars and explosions from supernovae, not from the center of the galaxy. This is because the gas isn't moving super fast and isn't losing too much mass.

In short, our study gives a lot of cool information about the gas in the northern part of Mrk273.

3953,1815.0,"In this paper, we investigate a degenerate chemotaxis system with flux limitation, and show that it exhibits a finite-time blow-up phenomena. The degeneracy is due to the presence of a flux limitation term that restricts the movement of the chemoattractant, causing it to pile up and creating a non-local repulsion effect. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to study the blow-up mechanism and the resulting singular solutions.

We first derive a set of necessary conditions for the blow-up to occur and show that they are satisfied in a certain range of parameters. We then construct explicit examples of solutions that develop finite-time blow-up and investigate their behavior. We observe that the blow-up solutions exhibit a self-similar behavior and a rapid concentration of the chemoattractant.

To analyze the singular behavior of the solutions, we introduce a new scaling law that captures the critical behavior of the system near the blow-up time. We show that the scaling law is consistent with the numerical simulations and allows us to derive the precise nature of the singularity.

Finally, we investigate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the blow-up phenomenon and show that it can delay or even prevent the occurrence of blow-up. We also discuss the biological implications of our results and how they can shed light on the mechanism underlying the patterning and aggregation of cells.

Our results provide a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between chemotaxis, flux limitation, and degeneracy, and uncover a new mechanism for finite-time blow-up in systems with non-local repulsion.",1,"In this paper, we look at a special kind of chemotaxis system that has limits on how things can move around, and we find out that it can suddenly get really big in a short time. The reason it gets so big is because there‚Äôs a limit that stops the chemoattractant (the stuff that attracts cells) from moving freely, which makes it stack up and push things away in a weird way. We use math and computer simulations to figure out how this sudden growth happens and what the strange solutions look like.

First, we find some important rules that need to be followed for this sudden growth to happen, and we show that these rules work in certain situations. Then, we create some examples of solutions that show this sudden growth and watch how they act. We notice that these solutions behave in a similar way and that the chemoattractant gathers really quickly.

To understand the strange behavior of these solutions better, we come up with a new way to measure things that helps us see what happens right before the sudden growth. We find that this new way matches what we see in our computer simulations and helps us understand the exact nature of the sudden growth.

Lastly, we check how differences in space can change the sudden growth and find out that they can slow it down or even stop it from happening. We also talk about what our findings mean for biology and how they can help explain how cells group together and form patterns.

Our findings help us understand better how chemotaxis, movement limits, and strange behaviors work together, and they show us a new way that sudden growth can happen in systems where things push away from each other.","In this study, we examine a degenerate chemotaxis system characterized by flux limitation, demonstrating that it exhibits a phenomenon of finite-time blow-up.

While following a ballistic trajectory, neither the rock nor a fly exerts downward force on the box (though their mass is accounted for). However, the complication arises because *a portion* of the box is descending. It is not possible to accurately determine the force needed to elevate the box if it is not being fully lifted. Typically, it is assumed in the scenario that the fly is either hovering or, on average, sustaining its elevation.","When the rock is in the air, does it make the box heavier? While the rock is following a ballistic path, neither it nor a fly is actually adding weight to the box, even though their mass is still part of the equation. The complication arises because a portion of the box is in free fall. If you're not lifting the entire box, you can't accurately measure the force needed to lift it.

4711,40641.0,"Staying motivated and disciplined can be difficult because our brains and bodies are naturally drawn to things that feel good in the short term, even if they might not be the best for us in the long term. For example, it might feel good to sit on the couch and watch TV or eat a delicious, unhealthy snack, but these things might not be as good for our overall health as exercising and eating healthy foods.

Our brains also have a system for rewards, which can make it hard to resist things that give us a quick burst of pleasure. This can be especially true when we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, because those feelings can make it harder to resist temptation.

One way to stay motivated and disciplined is to find ways to make healthy habits feel more rewarding. For example, you might find a type of exercise that you really enjoy, or look for healthy foods that taste good to you. You can also try setting small goals for yourself and rewarding yourself when you reach them, or finding a friend or group of people to support and motivate you.",1,"It can be tough to stay motivated and stick to good habits because our brains and bodies like things that make us feel good right away, even if they aren't the best for us later.

Our brains have a reward system that makes it hard to say no to things that give us a quick happy feeling. This is even harder when we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed because those feelings can make it tough to resist what we want.

One way to keep yourself motivated and disciplined is to make healthy habits feel more fun. You could find a type of exercise you really like or look for healthy foods that taste awesome to you. You can also set small goals and give yourself a little reward when you achieve them, or find a friend or a group to help cheer you on!","Maintaining motivation and discipline can prove to be challenging, as our brains and bodies are inherently inclined towards activities that provide immediate gratification, even if such activities may not be beneficial in the long term. For instance, while it may be pleasurable to relax on the couch and watch television or indulge in a tasty yet unhealthy snack, these choices may not contribute positively to our overall health compared to engaging in physical exercise and consuming nutritious foods.

Furthermore, our brains possess a reward system that complicates the ability to resist temptations that offer a swift sense of pleasure. This difficulty is often exacerbated during periods of stress or overwhelm, as such emotions can diminish our capacity to resist these temptations.

To enhance motivation and discipline, one effective strategy is to identify methods that render healthy habits more rewarding. For example, discovering a form of exercise that one genuinely enjoys or seeking out nutritious foods that are appealing can be beneficial. Additionally, setting small, achievable goals and rewarding oneself upon their attainment, or enlisting the support of a friend or a community, can further bolster motivation and discipline.","Staying motivated and disciplined can be a real challenge! Our brains and bodies often crave those instant feel-good moments, like binge-watching TV or indulging in tasty but unhealthy snacks. But let‚Äôs be real, these choices aren‚Äôt always the best for our long-term health. 

Our brains are wired for rewards, making it tough to resist quick pleasures, especially when stress hits. So, how can we stay on track? Try making healthy habits more enjoyable!

Additionally, the brain's reward system complicates the ability to resist activities that offer quick pleasure, particularly during periods of stress or overwhelm, which can heighten susceptibility to temptation.

To enhance motivation and discipline, it is effective to create a sense of reward around healthy habits. This could involve discovering enjoyable forms of exercise or identifying healthy foods that are appealing. Setting small, achievable goals and rewarding oneself upon completion, as well as seeking support from friends or groups, can also foster motivation and discipline.","It can be quite challenging to maintain motivation and discipline because our brains and bodies often gravitate towards activities that provide immediate pleasure, even if they aren't the best choices for our long-term well-being.

Additionally, our brains have a reward system that can make it tough to resist things that offer a quick sense of enjoyment. This struggle can intensify when we're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, as those emotions can weaken our ability to say no to temptations.

To help stay motivated and disciplined, it's useful to find ways to make healthy habits more appealing. You could discover a form of exercise that you genuinely enjoy or seek out healthy foods that you find delicious. Setting small, achievable goals and treating yourself when you accomplish them can also be effective.

3693,6914.0,"The managed-metabolism hypothesis suggests that a cooperation barrier must be overcome if self-producing chemical organizations are to transition from non-life to life. This barrier prevents un-managed, self-organizing, autocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex, cooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that could otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an organization will often not be supported within the organization, and because side reactions and other free-riding processes will undermine cooperation. As a result, the barrier seriously limits the possibility space that can be explored by un-managed organizations, impeding individuation, complex functionality and the transition to life. The barrier can be overcome comprehensively by appropriate management which implements a system of evolvable constraints. The constraints support beneficial co-operators and suppress free riders. In this way management can manipulate the chemical processes of an autocatalytic organization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the organization as a whole and that could not arise and persist spontaneously in an un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is able to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its management of an autocatalytic organization promotes beneficial cooperation.

This problem stops groups of tiny molecules from working together and becoming more complicated. The issue happens because some molecules that could help the group a lot don‚Äôt get the support they need, and other reactions can mess things up. Because of this, it‚Äôs really hard for these groups to grow and become alive. But if there‚Äôs good management, this problem can be fixed. Good management sets up rules that help the helpful molecules and stop the ones that don‚Äôt help. This way, management can change how the chemical group works, creating new ways that help the whole group, which wouldn‚Äôt happen if they were just left alone. Management can also benefit from helping the group work better together. So, the best managers will take charge of these chemical groups to help them get past the teamwork problem. The managed-metabolism idea explains that for management to really fix the teamwork problem, it needs to use a special code. This is how all living cells work, with a coded part that manages the other parts that help them stay alive.","The managed-metabolism hypothesis posits that a barrier to cooperation must be surmounted for self-producing chemical entities to evolve from non-life to life. This barrier inhibits unmanaged, self-organizing, autocatalytic networks of molecular species from developing into intricate, cooperative entities. The barrier exists because molecular species that could otherwise contribute significantly to the success of an organization are frequently unsupported within that organization, and because side reactions and other free-riding phenomena can undermine cooperation. Consequently, this barrier severely restricts the range of possibilities that unmanaged organizations can explore, thereby hindering individuation, complex functionality, and the transition to life. This barrier can be effectively overcome through appropriate management that establishes a system of evolvable constraints. These constraints are designed to support beneficial cooperators while suppressing free riders. In this manner, management can influence the chemical processes of an autocatalytic organization, generating novel processes that align with the interests of the organization as a whole and that could not spontaneously emerge and persist in an unmanaged chemical organization. Management itself self-organizes, as it is capable of capturing some of the benefits produced when its oversight of an autocatalytic organization fosters beneficial cooperation.

This barrier hinders the formation of complex, cooperative networks because beneficial molecular species often lack support, while side reactions can disrupt cooperation. Without proper management, these organizations struggle to develop individuality and functionality, limiting their potential. However, with effective management that establishes evolvable constraints, beneficial cooperation can thrive, and free riders can be suppressed. This management not only enhances the chemical processes but also leads to innovative outcomes that wouldn‚Äôt occur in unmanaged systems. As a result, managers emerge to guide these organizations, overcoming the cooperation barrier. The hypothesis emphasizes that for management to be effective, its interventions need to be digitally coded, explaining the dual structure of living cells where a coded genetic system oversees an analog metabolism. üß¨‚ú® #Science #Biology #ManagedMetabolism #LifeTransition","So, the managed-metabolism hypothesis says that there's this cooperation barrier that needs to be broken for self-producing chemical systems to go from non-life to life.

The issue is that the molecular species that could really help the organization often don‚Äôt get the support they need, plus there are side reactions and free-riding that mess things up. Because of this, it really limits what unmanaged organizations can do, making it hard for them to become more complex and transition to life. 

But, if you manage things right, you can totally get past this barrier by setting up some evolvable constraints. These constraints help the good co-operators and keep the free riders in check. So, management can actually change the chemical processes in an autocatalytic organization, leading to new processes that wouldn‚Äôt happen on their own in an unmanaged setup. 

Management kinda self-organizes too because it gets to enjoy some of the benefits when it helps cooperation. So, natural selection favors managers who can take charge and help these chemical organizations get over the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism hypothesis also points out that for management to really tackle this barrier, its actions need to be digitally coded.

I looked it up, and the most valuable beanie baby is a blue peanut worth almost $5,000! So, people thought if they collected them all, they could sell them later and be rich when they got older. 

It's kind of like other ways people try to get rich quickly today. The big difference is that beanie babies were sold with McDonald's, so everyone wanted at least one. Even though people dreamed of having fancy lunches with famous people, the beanie babies were still pretty expensive when they first came out. 

Collecting things is always a bit of a gamble. For example, if 100 people get something signed by Obama, his signature might not be super valuable right now, but later on, it could be worth a lot because he was the first Black president.

During the 1990s, society was grappling with a recession that stemmed from the excesses of the ""me"" generation of the 1980s. The enjoyment experienced during the 1980s ultimately led to financial difficulties for many, prompting a collective desire to discover quick avenues to wealth. The introduction of Beanie Babies, featuring numerous ""unique"" designs with limited production runs, sparked the belief that there existed a niche market of collectors. Individuals speculated that certain variants, such as the blue peanut Beanie Baby‚Äîwhich is reportedly valued at nearly $5,000‚Äîcould yield significant returns. This led many to consider amassing collections with the hope of selling them for substantial profits upon retirement. 

This phenomenon is not dissimilar to contemporary get-rich-quick schemes. A notable distinction, however, is that Beanie Babies were marketed in collaboration with McDonald's, facilitating their rapid global proliferation, resulting in widespread ownership of at least one Beanie Baby among the populace. Although aspirations of dining with Robin Leach did not materialize, the initial investment in these collectibles has proven to be quite valuable over time. 

Ultimately, the collectible market presents a win/lose scenario. For instance, if one were to acquire 100 signatures from former President Obama, the intrinsic value of his signature may not be significant at present; however, due to his historical significance as the first African American president, it is likely to appreciate in value over time. 

I began playing Magic: The Gathering upon its initial release and was fortunate enough to possess several Mox cards. While Black Lotuses were rare and highly sought after, I had accumulated five or six Mox cards in my deck. Eventually, I ceased playing altogether, having amassed a complete collection, along with numerous duplicates, of every card from the Alpha set. The continuous release of new expansions made it increasingly challenging to maintain my collection. 

A few years ago, I rediscovered my old deck, consisting of just 60 cards, most of which were from the Alpha set. Upon taking it to a local gaming shop, I was offered $5,000 for it. While I am uncertain if this was a fair transaction, receiving $5,000 for a collection of cards that were once relatively common during my playing days felt like a rewarding outcome.

Collectibles have always been a gamble. Take Obama‚Äôs signature, for example. It might not be worth much now, but it will eventually gain value because of his historic presidency. üñäÔ∏è 

I remember playing Magic: The Gathering when it first launched. I had a bunch of Moxes and even a few Black Lotuses. Fast forward to a couple of years ago, I found my old deck from Alpha and sold it for $5,000! üò≤ Not sure if I got a good deal, but it felt great considering I spent over $10,000 on the game back in the day. 

We all dream of striking it rich and finding the next big thing! üí≠‚ú® #Collectibles #BeanieBabies #MagicTheGathering #Nostalgia #GetRichQuick","hey! so like, those commemorative plates and minted coins, right? they say they're ""limited editions."" back in the '90s, we were dealing with a recession from the whole ""me"" generation in the '80s. we had a blast in the '80s, but then we were all kinda broke and looking for a quick way to get rich. then beanie babies popped up, with all these ""unique"" ones that were super rare. people thought, ""there's gotta be collectors out there, and maybe my peanut beanie is one of a kind!"" (i googled it, and the most valuable one is a blue peanut worth almost 5k!). so folks started collecting, thinking they could sell them for big bucks when they retired. it's basically the same as any get-rich-quick scheme today. the only twist is that beanie babies teamed up with McDonald's, so they blew up everywhere. suddenly, everyone had at least one. even tho dreams of lunch with Robin Leach didn‚Äôt happen, those babies are worth a lot now. 

it‚Äôs like the whole win/lose thing with collectibles. like, if 100 people get Obama‚Äôs autograph, it‚Äôs not super valuable right now, but since he‚Äôs the first black president, it‚Äôll be worth something eventually. I got into Magic: The Gathering when it first dropped. I had a few moxes and black lotuses were rare, but I had like 5 or 6 moxes in my deck. then I just stopped playing. I had a complete collection from Alpha and a box of duplicates, but keeping up with all the new expansions was too much. a couple years ago, I found my old deck‚Äîjust 60 cards, mostly from Alpha. took it to a local shop and they gave me $5,000 for it! idk if I got ripped off, but hey, 5k for 60 cards that were pretty common back then felt good. but honestly, I probably spent over 10k on the game when I was younger and living at home with no bills. we all wanna get rich and think we found the next big thing, right? *shrug*","Similar to commemorative plates and minted coins, these items are marketed as ""limited editions."" In the 1990s, we were attempting to counteract a recession that stemmed from the ""me"" generation of the 1980s. After enjoying the 1980s, many found themselves financially strained and seeking quick wealth opportunities. The introduction of Beanie Babies featured numerous ""unique"" designs, with limited production runs, leading people to believe there were collectors out there. The notion was that perhaps no one else possessed a specific variant, such as the blue peanut, which is reportedly valued at nearly $5,000. Collectors thought they could amass these toys and sell them for a profit in the future, envisioning a comfortable retirement. This scenario mirrors contemporary get-rich-quick schemes, with the distinction that Beanie Babies had a partnership with McDonald's, facilitating rapid global distribution. Consequently, many individuals owned at least one Beanie Baby. Although aspirations of dining with Robin Leach did not materialize, the initial investment in these toys has proven to be valuable. Ultimately, the collectible market presents a win/lose dynamic. For instance, if 100 individuals obtain Barack Obama's signature, its immediate value may be low, but due to his historical significance as the first Black president, it will likely appreciate over time. I began playing Magic: The Gathering at its inception and owned several Mox cards, while Black Lotuses were still rare. I had around 5 or 6 Mox cards in my deck. Eventually, I ceased playing altogether, despite having a complete collection from Alpha and a box of duplicates. The constant influx of new expansions made it challenging to keep up as a collector. A few years ago, I rediscovered my old deck, consisting of 60 cards, primarily from Alpha, and sold it to a local gaming shop for $5,000. While I am uncertain if I received a fair deal, $5,000 for cards that were once relatively common felt like a significant return. However, I likely invested over $10,000 into the game during my youth when I had a job and minimal expenses. The desire to achieve wealth and the hope of discovering the next big opportunity is a universal aspiration. *shrug*","Similar to commemorative plates and minted coins, items like beanie babies were marketed as ""limited editions.""

3133,11548.0,"Manipulation is a problem of fundamental importance in the context of voting in which the voters exercise their votes strategically instead of voting honestly to prevent selection of an alternative that is less preferred. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that there is no strategy-proof voting rule that simultaneously satisfies certain combinations of desirable properties.

Researchers have attempted to get around the impossibility results in several ways such as domain restriction and computational hardness of manipulation.

However these approaches have been shown to have limitations. Since prevention of manipulation seems to be elusive, an interesting research direction therefore is detection of manipulation. Motivated by this, we initiate the study of detection of possible manipulators in an election.

We formulate two pertinent computational problems - Coalitional Possible Manipulators (CPM) and Coalitional Possible Manipulators given Winner (CPMW), where a suspect group of voters is provided as input to compute whether they can be a potential coalition of possible manipulators. In the absence of any suspect group, we formulate two more computational problems namely Coalitional Possible Manipulators Search (CPMS), and Coalitional Possible Manipulators Search given Winner (CPMSW). We provide polynomial time algorithms for these problems, for several popular voting rules. For a few other voting rules, we show that these problems are in NP-complete.

3846,2621.0,"The identification and characterization of exoplanets have been at the forefront of astronomical research for decades. With recent advancements in observational techniques, the identification of circumstellar disks has become a valuable tool in understanding planetary formation processes. In this study, we present the discovery of an extrasolar ring system transiting a young sun-like star in the planetary construction zone. This has been made possible by detecting occultation events caused by the transiting disk. The disk is located at approximately 0.8 astronomical units from the star, and its structure suggests that it is capable of forming rocky planetesimals. 

Future prospects for detecting eclipses by circumsecondary and circumplanetary disks are promising, as evidenced by simulations conducted in this study. These eclipses can provide valuable information about the composition and structure of disks, as well as the exoplanets that may form within them. We propose that future observations should focus on young, sun-like stars with known circumstellar disks located in the planetary construction zone. 

Using the transit method, we were able to determine the size and location of the transiting disk with unprecedented accuracy. The results provide insight into the planetary formation process and suggest that the disk is a young and evolving system.

4468,24768.0,"The GPA system is a way of measuring academic achievement in the United States that assigns a numerical value to a student's grades. The 4-point GPA scale is the most commonly used scale in the United States, and it assigns a numerical value to each letter grade, with 4.0 being the highest possible GPA and 0.0 being the lowest. 
There are a few reasons why the GPA system is used in the United States instead of percentage grades. First, the GPA system allows for a more nuanced understanding of a student's grades. While a percentage grade gives a general idea of how well a student has performed, the GPA system allows for more precise comparisons between students. 
Second, the GPA system is more flexible than percentage grades. For example, if a student receives a 90% on one assignment and an 80% on another, their average percentage grade would be 85%. However, if the first assignment was worth twice as much as the second assignment, the student's grades would be weighted differently, and the GPA would reflect that. 
Finally, the GPA system is more widely used in the United States, so it is easier for universities to compare the grades of students from different schools. This can be particularly helpful when evaluating the academic achievements of international students, as different countries may use different grading systems.

It gives a number to their grades, and the most common scale goes from 0 to 4.0, where 4.0 is the best score you can get and 0.0 is the worst. 

There are a few reasons why schools use GPA instead of just saying a percentage. First, GPA helps to understand a student's grades better. A percentage shows how well someone did, but GPA helps to compare students more accurately. 

Second, GPA is more flexible than just using percentages. For example, if a student gets 90% on one test and 80% on another, their average would be 85%. But if the first test was more important, the GPA would show that difference. 

Lastly, since GPA is used a lot in the U.S., it makes it easier for colleges to compare students from different schools. This is really helpful for students from other countries because they might have different ways of grading. 

So, the GPA system is a handy and popular way to measure how well students are doing in school in the U.S. It helps to compare students better and is more flexible than just using percentages.","The Grade Point Average (GPA) system serves as a metric for assessing academic performance in the United States, assigning a numerical value to students' grades. The 4-point GPA scale is the most prevalent scale utilized in the country, where each letter grade corresponds to a specific numerical value, with 4.0 representing the highest attainable GPA and 0.0 the lowest.

There are several justifications for the adoption of the GPA system in the United States as opposed to percentage grades. Firstly, the GPA system facilitates a more nuanced comprehension of a student's academic performance. While a percentage grade provides a general indication of a student's achievement, the GPA system enables more precise comparisons among students.

Secondly, the GPA system offers greater flexibility compared to percentage grades.

Lastly, the GPA system enjoys widespread acceptance across the United States, simplifying the process for universities to compare the academic records of students from various institutions. This is particularly advantageous when assessing the academic accomplishments of international students, as different countries may employ diverse grading systems.

This study presents numerical simulations of AM CVn disks to investigate the effects of convection on magnetic turbulence. Our results show that convection-driven flows increase the magnetic turbulence in AM CVn disks, leading to enhanced accretion rates. We find that the convection-driven dynamo acts as a strong source of magnetic energy and generates intense magnetic turbulence, which subsequently accelerates gas accretion onto the central white dwarf. Additionally, we explore the role of magnetic Prandtl number and find that it critically affects the dynamo action and magnitude of turbulence. The magnetic Prandtl number is a measure of the efficiency of magnetic field diffusion through the turbulent plasma. Our results suggest that the AM CVn disk system is highly sensitive to the magnetic Prandtl number and that a low value enhances magnetic turbulence and accretion rates.

We also learned that there's something called the magnetic Prandtl number, which is important because it shows how well the magnetic field can move through the swirling gas. Our results show that the AM CVn disks are very sensitive to this number, and when it‚Äôs low, it makes the magnetic activity and gas pulling happen even more.

This is pretty important for understanding accretion disk theory and for observing AM CVn systems, which could be sources of gravitational waves!","AM CVn accretion disks are complex entities that display increased magnetic turbulence due to convection processes. This research provides numerical simulations of AM CVn disks to analyze the impact of convection on magnetic turbulence. The findings indicate that flows driven by convection amplify magnetic turbulence within AM CVn disks, resulting in higher accretion rates. It is observed that the convection-driven dynamo serves as a significant source of magnetic energy, producing substantial magnetic turbulence that accelerates gas accretion onto the central white dwarf. Furthermore, the study examines the influence of the magnetic Prandtl number, revealing its critical role in determining dynamo activity and turbulence intensity. The magnetic Prandtl number quantifies the effectiveness of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent plasma. The results imply that the AM CVn disk system is highly responsive to variations in the magnetic Prandtl number, with lower values leading to increased magnetic turbulence and accretion rates. These insights are significant for the theoretical understanding of accretion disks and the observational study of AM CVn systems, which may be potential sources of gravitational waves.","AM CVn accretion disks are fascinating structures that display increased magnetic turbulence due to convection.

We discovered that the convection-driven dynamo serves as a significant source of magnetic energy, producing strong magnetic turbulence that speeds up the gas accretion onto the central white dwarf. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the magnetic Prandtl number, which plays a crucial role in determining the dynamo's effectiveness and the level of turbulence. The magnetic Prandtl number reflects how efficiently magnetic fields diffuse through turbulent plasma.

3127,5804.0,"We report the first astrophysical application of the technique of wide-field Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

This powerful technique allows us to identify and measure sub-arcsecond compact components in low-frequency radio sources across large areas of sky without the need for long-baseline interferometry or ionospheric calibration. We present the results of a five-minute observation of a 30x30 sq. deg MWA field at 162 MHz with 0.5 second time resolution. Of the 2550 continuum sources detected in this field, 302 (12 per cent) show rapid fluctuations caused by IPS. We find that at least 32% of bright low-frequency radio sources contain a sub-arcsec compact component that contributes over 40% of the total flux density. Perhaps surprisingly, peaked-spectrum radio sources are the dominant population among the strongly-scintillating, low-frequency sources in our sample. While gamma-ray AGN are generally compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies, the 162 MHz properties of many of the Fermi blazars in our field are consistent with a compact component embedded within more extended low-frequency emission. The detection of a known pulsar in our field shows that the wide-field IPS technique is at the threshold of sensitivity needed to detect new pulsars using image plane analysis, and scaling the current MWA sensitivity to that expected for SKA-low implies that large IPS-based pulsar searches will be feasible with SKA. Calibration strategies for the SKA require a better knowledge of the space density of compact sources at low radio frequencies, which IPS observations can now provide.",0,"We are sharing the first time we used a cool method called wide-field Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) with a special telescope called the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to study space.

This neat technique helps us find and look at tiny parts of radio waves from space without needing super long tools or special adjustments for the atmosphere. We watched a big area of the sky that was 30x30 square degrees for five minutes at a frequency of 162 MHz and took pictures every half a second. We found 2,550 radio sources in that area, and 302 of them (which is about 12%) showed quick changes because of IPS. We discovered that at least 32% of the bright radio sources have tiny parts that make up more than 40% of the total signal. 

Surprisingly, the radio sources that have a peaked spectrum are the most common ones that show strong changes in our study. Even though gamma-ray AGN are usually small and have flat signals at higher frequencies, many of the Fermi blazars we looked at have properties at 162 MHz that suggest they have a small part mixed in with bigger signals. We also found a known pulsar in our area, which shows that this wide-field IPS method is good enough to find new pulsars by looking at images. If we make the MWA even more sensitive like the SKA-low telescope, we could search for lots of pulsars using IPS. To make the SKA work better, we need to know more about how many compact sources there are at low radio frequencies, and IPS observations can help us with that.","We present the inaugural astrophysical application of the wide-field Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) technique utilizing the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).

This advanced technique enables the identification and measurement of sub-arcsecond compact components in low-frequency radio sources over extensive regions of the sky, eliminating the necessity for long-baseline interferometry or ionospheric calibration. We detail the findings from a five-minute observation of a 30x30 square degree MWA field at a frequency of 162 MHz, with a time resolution of 0.5 seconds. Among the 2550 continuum sources identified within this field, 302 (12 percent) exhibit rapid fluctuations attributable to IPS. Our analysis reveals that at least 32% of prominent low-frequency radio sources possess a sub-arcsecond compact component that accounts for over 40% of the total flux density. Notably, peaked-spectrum radio sources emerge as the predominant category among the strongly scintillating low-frequency sources in our sample. While gamma-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically characterized as compact, flat-spectrum radio sources at higher frequencies, the properties of numerous Fermi blazars in our field at 162 MHz suggest the presence of a compact component situated within a more extensive low-frequency emission. The identification of a known pulsar within our field indicates that the wide-field IPS technique is approaching the sensitivity threshold required for the detection of new pulsars through image plane analysis. Furthermore, extrapolating the current MWA sensitivity to anticipated levels for SKA-low suggests that extensive pulsar searches based on IPS will be feasible with the SKA.

Dr. Rob Johns from Essex added that the shift back to No started before the famous 'Vow' on the Daily Record cover. He said it's common for misleading stories to pop up about what swayed an election or referendum. According to their data, anyone thinking ""it was the Vow that won it"" is kinda exaggerating. But once these stories get out, they‚Äôre tough to change, and we might see this play out in the general election in May.

YouGov asked 4,849 people from Aug 22 to Sept 17, 2014, and then another 3,719 from Sept 22 to 26. John Lamont from the Scottish Conservatives said all pro-UK parties had plans for a stronger Scottish Parliament before the referendum, and whoever wins the general election will make sure those powers happen. He said they‚Äôve kept their promises about delivering those powers, despite what Alex Salmond says.

A Scottish Labour rep said it‚Äôs cool to do these studies, but at the end of the day, a lot of people voted to stay in the UK. An SNP spokesperson said they were bummed about the referendum result, but this study shows more political engagement, especially among young folks, which is a good thing. They also mentioned that right after the referendum, a quarter of No voters thought the promise of extra powers was important, and nearly 10% of them decided in the last week. They believe the Westminster parties put out the Vow because they thought it would really affect the outcome.","Academics from the universities of Edinburgh and Essex initiated a survey involving several thousand voters. The findings revealed that only 3.4% of ""No"" voters considered ""The Vow"" as the primary reason for their choice. An SNP representative stated that polling conducted right after the September vote yielded different outcomes. Research from the Centre on Constitutional Change indicated that the predominant reason cited by opponents of independence for their decision was ""feeling British/believe in the Union,"" mentioned by 29.5%. Additional factors were also noted.

Yes voters identified various reasons for their defeat. Ailsa Henderson, co-author of the report from the University of Edinburgh, remarked: ""There is a clear discrepancy between Yes voters' perception that the promise of more powers was a significant campaign element and the reality of how No voters made their choice. The issue of 'more powers' is not recognized as the primary reason for voting No. However, Yes voters believe it led to a loss of confidence in supporting the Union.""

Dr. Rob Johns from the University of Essex added: ""The trend of opinion during the campaign indicates that the shift back to No occurred before the notable 'Vow' featured on the Daily Record's front page. It is common for misleading narratives to emerge regarding what influenced an election or referendum. Our data suggests that those who believe 'it was the Vow that won it' are overstating the case. Nevertheless, once such narratives take hold, they can be difficult to change. We may observe the impact of this narrative during the general election in May.""

YouGov surveyed 4,849 individuals between August 22 and September 17, 2014, and an additional 3,719 from September 22 to 26. Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont stated: ""All three pro-UK parties proposed plans for a more empowered Scottish Parliament prior to the referendum, and regardless of who is in power after the general election, those powers will be implemented to enhance the responsibility and accountability of Holyrood. Contrary to Alex Salmond's claims, we have fulfilled our commitments regarding these powers.""

A Scottish Labour spokesperson remarked: ""While these academic analyses are intriguing, ultimately, a significant majority of the electorate chose to remain part of the UK."" An SNP spokesperson stated: ""Although we were disheartened by the referendum outcome, this study indicates that a notable legacy has been increased political engagement, especially among young people, which is commendable.

The latest study from the Centre on Constitutional Change indicated that the main reason cited by those against independence was a sense of being British or a belief in the Union, which was mentioned by 29.5% of respondents.

Other reasons were also noted, particularly by Yes voters reflecting on their loss. Ailsa Henderson, one of the report's authors from the University of Edinburgh, remarked, ""There is a clear gap between how Yes voters perceive the importance of the promise of more powers in the campaign and the reality of how No voters made their choice.

Each sport has its own unique way of determining the pot and purse, often based on factors like sponsorship deals, ticket sales, and viewership. For instance, in tennis, the prize money can vary greatly between tournaments, with Grand Slams offering the biggest payouts due to their high-profile status and massive audience. üèÜüéæ What‚Äôs your favorite sport and how do you think they should determine the prize money? Share your thoughts! üëá‚ú® #Sports #PrizeMoney #Competition","Sure! So, like in tennis, the pot (or prize money) is usually based on how much money the tournament makes from ticket sales, sponsorships, and broadcasting rights. The better the tournament, the bigger the purse. For example, at Grand Slam events, the total prize money can be in the millions, and it gets divided among players based on how far they go in the tournament. So, if you win, you get a bigger slice of that pie! üèÜüí∞",Please provide an example of how the prize pool and financial rewards are established in a particular sport or competition.,"Sure! In many sports, the prize money, often referred to as the pot, is usually determined by factors like ticket sales, sponsorship deals, and broadcasting rights. For instance, in professional golf tournaments, the total purse is often a percentage of the revenue generated from these sources. The more popular the event, the larger the pot tends to be. 

In a specific competition, like a major tennis tournament, the organizers might set the total prize money based on the number of participants and the level of sponsorship they secure. For example, if a tournament attracts a lot of viewers and has significant sponsorship backing, the purse can be quite substantial, with top players receiving a larger share based on their performance."

938,273.0,"The UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.
It is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.
Since the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.
That is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.
US President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.
It was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.
It was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a ""new Middle East"".
Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).
Viscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.
He found himself knocking on an open door.
If he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.
They were using him, and he was using them.
With the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.
But Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.
But it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.
In the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.
Thousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.
IS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.
Now it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.
That is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.
Doing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.",0,"The UK is really nervous and waiting for the results of the Chilcot enquiry, which has taken a long time to finish. They are also thinking hard about whether to join the Americans and others in bombing the bad guys in Syria, called the Islamic State (IS), who many believe got stronger because of the invasion in 2003.

Since the Syrian crisis started in 2011, the Americans and their friends have been watching the mess in Iraq and learning what not to do in Syria. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been careful about getting involved in Syria. President Obama was elected to stop getting into foreign wars, not to start new ones. He only agreed to do airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria very reluctantly and sent a few advisers and special forces to help.

Back in 2002 and 2003, things were different. Some people in Washington wanted to find any reason to attack Iraq and get rid of Saddam Hussein to create a ""new Middle East."" Ahmed Chalabi, who left Iraq in 1956, was leading a group of people in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC). He really wanted to get rid of Saddam and tried to convince the Americans to invade because he thought other ways wouldn‚Äôt work.

Chalabi knew that he could trick Washington with false information about Saddam‚Äôs weapons and connections to terrorism, and the Americans were eager to believe him as they got ready for war. They were using each other.

Now, with the Chilcot report coming soon, Tony Blair, who took the UK into the Iraq war with the Americans, recently said sorry in an interview for using wrong information to start the war and not thinking about what would happen next. But Chalabi didn‚Äôt feel bad about it. He was still proud of helping to start the invasion that got rid of Saddam, thinking it was worth it no matter what.

However, just getting rid of Saddam didn‚Äôt fix Iraq. After the invasion, everything that held the country together fell apart, like the Baath Party, the army, and the intelligence services. Many experienced officers from Saddam‚Äôs Sunni community were sent home angry, which led to more fighting and the rise of IS.

IS started in Iraq and then spread to Syria, where it took advantage of the chaos from the civil war. It even came back to Iraq and took over Mosul last year. Now, IS is strong in both countries, and it‚Äôs really hard to bring them back together as one country because they are so divided.

This situation is worrying for the West, especially since many people","The United Kingdom is currently in a state of anticipation, awaiting the results of the long-postponed Chilcot inquiry into the events surrounding the Iraq War, which are expected to be released in the coming weeks. Concurrently, there is considerable deliberation regarding the possibility of joining the United States and other nations in extending military operations from Iraq into Syria, targeting the militants of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS). The emergence of IS is widely regarded as a direct consequence of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent turmoil that ensued.

Since the onset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have been acutely aware of the chaos in Iraq, serving as a cautionary example of how not to engage with the situation in Syria. This understanding has been a significant factor in their hesitance to become involved in the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama was elected on a platform that emphasized the cessation of foreign military interventions, aiming to avoid entanglement in another conflict. His involvement in airstrikes against IS in both Iraq and Syria was undertaken with great reluctance, characterized by a limited and cautious deployment of advisers and special forces.

The context was markedly different in 2002 and 2003, when neo-conservative elements in Washington sought any justification to initiate military action against Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader strategy to reshape the Middle East. At that time, Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, led the Iraqi National Council (INC), an umbrella organization of opposition groups in exile. Deeply committed to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi became a key figure in advocating for American intervention, having lost faith in the possibility of an internal coup.

Chalabi found a receptive audience in Washington, where he may have knowingly provided misleading intelligence regarding Saddam's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction and alleged connections to international terrorism. He recognized that influential circles in the United States were eager to accept such information without critical examination as they prepared for their preferred military engagement. This relationship was mutually beneficial; Chalabi utilized American support while they, in turn, relied on his insights.

As the conclusions of the Chilcot inquiry approach, Tony Blair, who was instrumental in leading the UK into the Iraq War alongside the United States, recently expressed a qualified apology during a CNN interview. He acknowledged that the intelligence underpinning the invasion was flawed and that insufficient consideration was given to the post-invasion scenario. In contrast, Chalabi expressed no such regrets. In discussions late last year,","The UK is on edge, eagerly awaiting the results of the long-overdue Chilcot inquiry in the coming weeks. There's also a tough decision looming about whether to join the US and allies in expanding the bombing campaign from Iraq to Syria against the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS), which many believe emerged due to the 2003 invasion and its aftermath. 

Since the Syrian crisis began in 2011, the chaos in Iraq has served as a cautionary tale for the West on how NOT to handle Syria. This is why they've been hesitant to get involved. President Obama campaigned on ending foreign military interventions, and only reluctantly engaged in airstrikes against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited ground support.

Flashback to 2002-2003, when neo-conservatives were eager to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, with Ahmed Chalabi leading the charge from exile. He pushed for the invasion, even if it meant using questionable intelligence about WMDs. As the Chilcot report approaches, Tony Blair has offered a qualified apology for the flawed intelligence that led to war, but Chalabi remains proud of his role in the invasion.

However, the removal of Saddam didn't bring stability; it dismantled Iraq's political and security structures, leading to chaos and the rise of IS. Now, IS is entrenched in both Iraq and Syria, making the prospect of restoring unity in these countries seem nearly impossible. The West is grappling with how to address this crisis, which has caused millions of refugees to flee, with many seeking safety in Europe. Ignoring the situation may not be an option, but the lessons from Iraq since 2003 highlight the risks of poorly thought-out interventions. #ChilcotInquiry #MiddleEastCrisis #IS","OMG, the UK is like super anxious right now, waiting for the Chilcot enquiry results that have been delayed for ages. They're also stressing over whether to join the US and others in expanding their bombing from Iraq to Syria against those IS militants, who many think popped up because of the 2003 invasion and all the chaos that followed.

Since the Syrian crisis kicked off in 2011, the US and its Western buddies have been totally freaked out by the mess in Iraq, using it as a lesson on how NOT to handle Syria. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been super careful about getting involved there. Obama was elected to end those foreign wars, not dive into another one. He only got into the airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria reluctantly, and even then, it was just a limited engagement with some advisers and special forces.

Back in 2002-2003, it was a whole different story. The neo-cons in Washington were looking for any excuse to go after Iraq and take down Saddam, trying to create a ""new Middle East."" Ahmed Chalabi, who left Iraq in '56, was leading the Iraqi National Council (INC) and was all about getting rid of Saddam. He was pushing hard for the US to invade since he thought other methods wouldn‚Äôt work.

He basically walked into a situation where the US was ready to listen. If he misled them with fake intel about Saddam‚Äôs non-existent WMDs and ties to terrorism, he knew the US was eager to believe it as they prepped for war. They were using each other, for sure.

Now with the Chilcot report coming, Tony Blair, who took the UK into the Iraq war with the US, recently kinda apologized in a CNN interview, admitting the intel was wrong and they didn‚Äôt think enough about what would happen next. But Chalabi didn‚Äôt have any regrets. He was still pumped about his role in getting the invasion going, thinking that was the main goal, no matter the cost.

But just getting rid of Saddam didn‚Äôt fix things. After the invasion, they dismantled all the political and security structures, including the Baath Party, army, and intelligence services. Thousands of experienced Sunni officials were sent home, which led to a Sunni insurgency, sectarian violence, and eventually IS popping up.

IS started in Iraq and then spread to Syria, taking advantage of the chaos from the civil war, and then they stormed back into Iraq, taking Mosul last year. Now they‚Äôre firmly in both countries, and it","The United Kingdom is currently anticipating the outcomes of the long-postponed Chilcot inquiry regarding past events, expected in the upcoming weeks. Additionally, there is significant deliberation on whether to align with the United States and other nations in broadening its bombing operations from Iraq to Syria, targeting the militants of the self-identified Islamic State (IS), whose emergence is largely attributed to the 2003 invasion and the subsequent turmoil.

Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the United States and its Western allies have been acutely aware of the disorder in Iraq, serving as a cautionary example of ineffective intervention in Syria. This awareness has been a primary factor in their cautious approach to involvement in the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama was elected on a promise to conclude such foreign interventions rather than engage in new ones. His entry into airstrikes against IS in both Iraq and Syria was met with considerable reluctance, involving only limited and careful deployment of advisers and special forces.

In contrast, during 2002 and 2003, the neo-conservative faction in Washington sought any justification to act against Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein, aiming to reshape the region into a ""new Middle East."" Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, led the Iraqi National Council (INC), an opposition group in exile, and was fervently committed to overthrowing Saddam. He became a key figure in persuading the U.S. to invade Iraq, having lost faith in alternative strategies like orchestrating an internal coup.

Chalabi found a receptive audience in Washington, where he may have provided misleading intelligence regarding Saddam's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to terrorism, knowing that influential American circles were eager to accept such claims as they prepared for war. Both parties were utilizing each other for their respective agendas.

As the Chilcot report approaches, Tony Blair, who supported the Iraq war alongside the U.S., recently expressed a conditional apology in a CNN interview, acknowledging that the intelligence justifying the invasion was flawed and that insufficient planning was conducted for post-invasion governance. In contrast, Chalabi expressed no regrets about his role in instigating the invasion that ousted Saddam, viewing it as a justified means to an end.

However, the removal of Saddam did not solely account for the ensuing chaos in Iraq. Following the invasion, the dismantling of the country's political and security frameworks, including the Baath Party, army, and intelligence services, occurred. This led to the dismissal of numerous experienced officials from Saddam's Sunni minority, fostering resentment","The UK is anxiously awaiting the results of the long-overdue Chilcot inquiry into the events surrounding the Iraq War, which are expected in the coming weeks. At the same time, there is a growing debate about whether to join the US and other allies in expanding their bombing campaign from Iraq into Syria against the militants of the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS). The rise of IS is largely viewed as a direct result of the 2003 invasion and the chaos that followed.

Since the Syrian crisis began in 2011, the US and its Western allies have been wary of the turmoil in Iraq, seeing it as a cautionary tale for how not to approach the situation in Syria. This has been a significant factor in their hesitance to get involved in the Syrian conflict. President Barack Obama was elected on a promise to end foreign military interventions, not to become entangled in another one. He only reluctantly engaged in airstrikes against IS in both Iraq and Syria, opting for a limited and cautious deployment of advisers and special forces.

This cautious approach contrasts sharply with the mindset of 2002 and 2003, when neo-conservatives in Washington were eager to find any justification to invade Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein, driven by a broader vision of reshaping the Middle East. Ahmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, was leading the Iraqi National Council (INC) at that time. Deeply committed to ousting Saddam, Chalabi became a key figure in persuading the US to invade, having lost faith in other methods like orchestrating an internal coup.

Chalabi found a receptive audience in Washington, and while he may have provided misleading intelligence about Saddam's nonexistent weapons of mass destruction and supposed ties to terrorism, he was aware that influential American circles were ready to accept his claims without question as they geared up for war. Both sides were using each other to achieve their goals.

As the Chilcot report approaches, Tony Blair, who took the UK into the Iraq War alongside the US, recently expressed a qualified apology in a CNN interview, acknowledging that the intelligence justifying the invasion was flawed and that not enough consideration was given to the aftermath. In contrast, Chalabi showed no regrets; in discussions late last year, he remained proud of his role in instigating the invasion that toppled Saddam, believing that the end justified the means.

However, the removal of Saddam did not alone account for the chaos that has plagued Iraq since then. In the aftermath, the political and security frameworks that held the country together"

3126,7666.0,"We study the statistics of the work done in a zero temperature quench of the coupling constant in the Dicke model describing the interaction between a gas of two level atoms and a single electromagnetic cavity mode.

This model shows how a group of atoms that can be in two states interacts with a light wave in a box.

If we start with a connection strength close to this critical point, the average work we measure gets really big. But if we end close to this critical point, the work done has some strange patterns but still behaves in a normal way. This difference happens because of how we squish or stretch a particle when we suddenly change how it is held.
